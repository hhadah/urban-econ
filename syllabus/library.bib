abstract = {Aging men and women are increasingly remaining in the labor force. Most often the reason for this is that they need to work additional years in order to be able to support an increasing number of years in retirement. This leaves employers scrambling for ways to adapt to a growing number of retirement-aged workers. Clark and Morrill provide a thorough assessment of the costs and benefits of accommodating later retirement ages, and they describe options employers may use to create some new form of employment contract with aging workers. The most prominent issues employers with aging workers face are declining productivity, rising labor and benefits costs, and a suboptimal age distribution of their workforces. According to the authors, employers could respond to these issues by finding new ways to accommodate older workers with, for instance, phased retirement and return-to-work policies. But the success of such policies also depends on tax policies and whether government-provided retirement benefits could be redesigned to play a role in a newly-defined employment relationship.},

abstract = {The article studies the evolution of the constitutional arrangements in seventeenth-century England following the Glorious Revolution of 1688. It focuses on the relationship between institutions and the behavior of the government and interprets the institutional changes on the basis of the goals of the winners-secure property rights, protection of their wealth, and the elimination of confiscatory government. We argue that the new institutions allowed the government to commit credibly to upholding property rights. Their success was remarkable, as the evidence from capital markets shows.},

@article{Lee2008,
abstract = {This paper establishes the relatively weak conditions under which causal inferences from a regression-discontinuity (RD) analysis can be as credible as those from a randomized experiment, and hence under which the validity of the RD design can be tested by examining whether or not there is a discontinuity in any pre-determined (or "baseline") variables at the RD threshold. Specifically, consider a standard treatment evaluation problem in which treatment is assigned to an individual if and only if V {\textgreater} v0, but where v0 is a known threshold, and V is observable. V can depend on the individual's characteristics and choices, but there is also a random chance element: for each individual, there exists a well-defined probability distribution for V. The density function-allowed to differ arbitrarily across the population-is assumed to be continuous. It is formally established that treatment status here is as good as randomized in a local neighborhood of V = v0. These ideas are illustrated in an analysis of U.S. House elections, where the inherent uncertainty in the final vote count is plausible, which would imply that the party that wins is essentially randomized among elections decided by a narrow margin. The evidence is consistent with this prediction, which is then used to generate "near-experimental" causal estimates of the electoral advantage to incumbency. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Objective: To examine similarities and differences in demographics and key substance use and mental health outcomes in a probability sample of heterosexual women and two samples of sexual minority women (SMW), one recruited using probability and the other using non-probability methods. Methods: Using data from four waves of the National Alcohol Survey (NAS; n = 315 SMW; 10,523 heterosexual women) and Wave 3 of the Chicago Health and Life Experiences of Women (CHLEW; n = 688 SMW) study, we examined hazardous drinking, drug use, tobacco use, depression, and help-seeking for alcohol or other drug problems. Results: Compared to SMW in the probability sample, SMW in the non-probability sample were older, more likely to be college educated, and more likely to be in a partnered relationship. Compared to heterosexuals, SMW in both the probability and non-probability samples had greater odds of past-year hazardous drinking, marijuana use, and other drug use. We found similar results for lifetime help-seeking for alcohol or drug problems, past week depression, and co-occurring hazardous drinking and depression. In comparisons with heterosexual women, the magnitude of difference for drug use was greater for the SMW non-probability sample; for tobacco use, the difference was greater for the SMW probability sample. Conclusion: Given the difficulties recruiting probability samples of SMW, researchers will continue to use non-probability samples in the foreseeable future. Thus, understanding how findings may differ between probability and non-probability samples is critically important in advancing research on sexual-orientation-related health disparities.},

Exploiting variation in the age of children when families move, we find that neighborhoods have significant childhood exposure effects: the out- comes of children whose families move to a better neighborhood—as measured by the outcomes of children already living there—improve linearly in proportion to the amount oftime they spend growing up in that area, at a rate ofapproximately 4{\%} per year of exposure. We distinguish the causal effects of neighborhoods from confounding factors by comparing the outcomes of siblings within families, study- ing moves triggered by displacement shocks, and exploiting sharp variation in predicted place effects across birth cohorts, genders, and quantiles to implement overidentification tests. The findings show that neighborhoods affect intergenerational mobility primarily through childhood exposure, helping reconcile conflicting results in the prior literature.},

abstract = {Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental designs like regression discontinuity (RD) designs, instrumental variable (IV) designs, and matching and propensity score (PS) designs are frequently used for inferring causal effects. It is well known that the features of these designs facilitate the identification of a causal estimand and, thus, warrant a causal interpretation of the estimated effect. In this article, we discuss and compare the identifying assumptions of quasi-experiments using causal graphs. The increasing complexity of the causal graphs as one switches from an RCT to RD, IV, or PS designs reveals that the assumptions become stronger as the researcher's control over treatment selection diminishes. We introduce limiting graphs for the RD design and conditional graphs for the latent subgroups of compliers, always takers, and never takers of the IV design, and argue that the PS is a collider that offsets confounding bias via collider bias.},

We conduct a r{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}} field experiment in all US states to study how state laws protecting older workers from age discrimination affect age discrimination in hiring for retail sales jobs. We relate the difference in callback rates between old and young applicants to states' variation in age and disability discrimination laws. These laws could boost hiring of older applicants, although they could have the unintended consequence of deterring hiring if they increase termination costs. In our preferred estimates that are weighted to be representative of the workforce, we find evidence that there is less discrimination against older men and women in states where age discrimination law allows larger damages and more limited evidence that there is less discrimination against older women in states where disability discrimination law allows larger damages. Our clearest result is that the laws do not have the unintended consequence of lowering callbacks for older workers.},

In most countries, these programmes are large and growing, both in expenditure and in number of recipients. We discuss the traditional trade-off between insurance and incentives in providing this insurance, with a focus on the US and UK experiences. There is substantial evidence on the extent of the labour supply incentive costs of disability insurance, but there has been a lack of evidence on the insurance value until very recently. Further, evidence on errors in the disability insurance process suggests false rejections of genuine claimants is a substantial problem, and these are more serious than false acceptances of healthy applicants. We provide a life-cycle framework for understanding the trade-offs and to evaluate the welfare implications of policy reforms. We argue that reforms should be focused on reducing false rejections and supporting labour market attachment. The difficulty in considering reform is that the design of disability insurance has many aspects that interact and impact on outcomes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: COPD is thought to be more prevalent among men than women, a finding usually attributed to higher smoking rates and more frequent occupational exposures of significance for men. However, smoking prevalence has increased among women and there is evidence that women may be more susceptible to the adverse pulmonary function effects of smoking than men. There may also be underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis of COPD in both sexes because objective measures of lung function are underused.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: We undertook the present study to determine if there is gender bias in the diagnosis of COPD, such that women are less likely than men to receive a diagnosis of COPD. We also attempted to determine if underuse of lung function measurements was a factor in any bias detected.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We surveyed a random sample of 192 primary-care physicians (96 American and 96 Canadian; 154 men and 38 women) using a hypothetical case presentation and a structured interview. The case of cough and dyspnea in a smoker was presented in six versions differing only in the age and sex of the patient. After presentation of the history and physical findings, physicians were asked to state the most probable diagnosis and to choose the diagnostic studies needed. Physicians were then presented with spirometric findings of moderate or severe obstruction without significant bronchodilator response, and the questions repeated. Finally, the negative outcome of an oral steroid trial was described.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Initially, COPD was given as the most probable diagnosis significantly more often for men than women (58{\%} vs 42{\%}; p {\textless} 0.05). The likelihood of a COPD diagnosis increased significantly and initial differences between sexes decreased as objective information was provided. After spirometry, COPD diagnosis rates for men and women were 74{\%} vs 66{\%} (p = not significant); after the steroid trial 85{\%} vs 79{\%} (p = not significant). Only 22{\%} of physicians would have requested spirometry after the initial presentation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In North America, primary-care physicians underdiagnosed COPD, particularly in women. Spirometry reduces the risk of underdiagnosis and gender bias but is underused.},

@article{Ichino1999,
abstract = {Several recent studies based on 'exogenous' sources of variation in educational outcomes show IV estimates of returns to schooling that are substantially higher than the corresponding OLS estimates. Card (1995a, Earnings, schooling, and ability revisited. Research in Labor Economics 14, 23-48) suggests that these results are explained by the existence of heterogenity in individual returns and by the fact that these studies are based on instruments that influence only the educational decision of individuals with high marginal returns due to either liquidity constraints or to high ability. This conclusion is consistent with the local average treatment effect (LATE) interpretation of IV (Imbens and Angrist, 1994, Identification and estimation of local average treatment effects. Econometrica 62, 467-475) according to which IV identifies only the average returns of those who comply with the assignment-to-treatment mechanism implied by the instrument. We show evidence for Germany suggesting that returns to schooling are heterogeneous, instruments matter and the LATE interpretation of IV makes sense. With an appropriate choice of instruments we also show how IV can be used to approximate the range of variations of returns to schooling in Germany.},

As in the 1991 data analyzed by Angrist and Lavy (1999), Maimonides Rule still has a strong first stage. In contrast with the earlier Israeli estimates, however, Maimonides-based instrumental variables estimates using more recent data show no effect of class size on achievement. The new data also reveal substantial enrollment sorting near Maimonides cutoffs, with too many schools having enrollment values that just barely produce an extra class. A modified rule that uses data on students' birthdays to compute statutory enrollment in the absence of enrollment manipulation also generates a precisely estimated zero. In older data, the original Maimonides Rule is unrelated to socioeconomic characteristics, while in more recent data, the original rule is unrelated to socioeconomic characteristics conditional on a few controls. Enrollment manipulation therefore appears to be innocuous: neither the original negative effects nor the recent data zeros seem likely to be manipulation artifacts.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients from racial and ethnic minority groups use fewer health care services and are less satisfied with their care than patients from the majority white population. These disparities may be attributable in part to racial or cultural differences between patients and their physicians. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether racial concordance between patients and physicians affects patients' satisfaction with and use of health care. METHODS: We analyzed data from the 1994 Commonwealth Fund's Minority Health Survey, a nationwide, telephone survey of noninstitutionalized adults. For the 2201 white, black, and Hispanic respondents who reported having a regular physician, we examined the association between patient-physician racial concordance and patients' ratings of their physicians, satisfaction with health care, reported receipt of preventive care, and reported receipt of needed medical care. RESULTS: Black respondents with black physicians were more likely than those with nonblack physicians to rate their physicians as excellent (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.40; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.55-3.72) and to report receiving preventive care (adjusted OR, 1.74; 95{\%} CI, 1.01-2.98) and all needed medical care (adjusted OR, 2.94; 95{\%} CI, 1.10-7.87) during the previous year. Hispanics with Hispanic physicians were more likely than those with non-Hispanic physicians to be very satisfied with their health care overall (adjusted OR, 1.74; 95{\%} CI, 1.01-2.99). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the importance of racial and cultural factors in the patient-physician relationship and reaffirm the role of black and Hispanic physicians in caring for black and Hispanic patients. Improving cultural competence among physicians may enhance the quality of health care for minority populations. In the meantime, by reducing the number of underrepresented minorities entering the US physician workforce, the reversal of affirmative action policies may adversely affect the delivery of health care to black and Hispanic Americans.},

abstract = {Sexual minority youth (youth who are attracted to the same sex or endorse a gay/lesbian/bisexual identity) report significantly higher rates of depression and suicidality than heterosexual youth. The minority stress hypothesis contends that the stigma and discrimination experienced by sexual minority youth create a hostile social environment that can lead to chronic stress and mental health problems. The present study used longitudinal mediation models to directly test sexual minority-specific victimization as a potential explanatory mechanism of the mental health disparities of sexual minority youth. One hundred ninety-seven adolescents (14-19 years old; 70 {\%} female; 29 {\%} sexual minority) completed measures of sexual minority-specific victimization, depressive symptoms, and suicidality at two time points 6 months apart. Compared to heterosexual youth, sexual minority youth reported higher levels of sexual minority-specific victimization, depressive symptoms, and suicidality. Sexual minority-specific victimization significantly mediated the effect of sexual minority status on depressive symptoms and suicidality. The results support the minority stress hypothesis that targeted harassment and victimization are partly responsible for the higher levels of depressive symptoms and suicidality found in sexual minority youth. This research lends support to public policy initiatives that reduce bullying and hate crimes because reducing victimization can have a significant impact on the health and well-being of sexual minority youth.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Five new initiatives were introduced and discussed for improving economics education. Education specialists agree that instructors should use active learning, which may be particularly important in economic education where the overarching goal is to help students think like economists. Active learning helps students think like economists by providing structured opportunities where they apply economic ideas to answer questions and solve problems. Additional topics included more focus on PhD research, improving assessment methods, long-term effects of learning economics and using technology in economic education.},

This study explored correlates of TGNC counseling competencies among psychologists and mental health practitioners. Participants (n = 102) included master's level counselors and social workers, as well as doctoral-level psychologists. Participants were recruited from a national multicultural counseling conference that took place in the United States, and they each anonymously completed a questionnaire packet. Controlling for social desirability, a blockwise hierarchical regression indicated that several practitioner identity-related variables contributed to the TGNC counseling competencies. Self-identifying as a sexual minority, self-identifying as a racial/ethnic minority, and being an advanced career professional with 8 or more years of clinical experience predicted TGNC counseling competencies. Implications for education, practice, and future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Drawing on theories of stereotype content and role congruity, this research investigated the role of stereotypes for employment discrimination against older candidates. Study 1 investigated the content of stereotypes about older workers, focusing on warmth and competence as the two core dimensions in social judgement. As predicted, older workers were perceived as less competent but warmer than younger workers. Studies 2 and 3 investigated how these stereotypes interact with job requirements to predict age bias in an experimental setting. Further, they tested if warmth- and competence-related stereotypical inferences mediate the relation between candidate age and selection bias. Results showed that age bias was robust. Older candidates were discriminated against, even if the job primarily required warmth-related qualities, and independently of evaluators' own age or professional experience in human resources. Moreover, age bias was mediated by competence-related stereotypical inferences. Age bias was also mediated by inferences related to warmth but those inferences were opposite to the high- warmth older worker stereotype identified in Study 1. Implications of the findings for theoretical approaches to age discrimination and for organizational practice designed to combat age discrimination are discussed.},

abstract = {In many countries, important thresholds in examinations act as a gateway to higher levels of education and/or good employment prospects. This paper examines the consequences of just failing a key high stakes national examination in English taken at the end of compulsory schooling in England. It uses unique administrative data to show that students of the same ability have significantly different educational trajectories depending on whether or not they just pass or fail this exam. Three years later, students who just fail to achieve the required threshold have a lower probability of entering an upper-secondary high-level academic or vocational track and of starting tertiary education. Those who fail to pass the threshold are also more likely to drop out of education by age 18, without some form of employment. The moderately high effects of just passing or failing to pass the threshold in this high stakes exam are therefore a source of educational inequality with high potential long-term consequences for those affected.},

abstract = {Researchers who analyze data within the framework of null hypothesis significance testing must choose a critical “alpha” level, $\alpha$, to use as a cutoff for deciding whether a given set of data demonstrates the presence of a particular effect. In most fields, $\alpha$ = 0.05 has traditionally been used as the standard cutoff. Many researchers have recently argued for a change to a more stringent evidence cutoff such as $\alpha$ = 0.01, 0.005, or 0.001, noting that this change would tend to reduce the rate of false positives, which are of growing concern in many research areas. Other researchers oppose this proposed change, however, because it would correspondingly tend to increase the rate of false negatives. We show how a simple statistical model can be used to explore the quantitative tradeoff between reducing false positives and increasing false negatives. In particular, the model shows how the optimal $\alpha$ level depends on numerous characteristics of the research area, and it reveals that although $\alpha$ = 0.05 would indeed be approximately the optimal value in some realistic situations, the optimal $\alpha$ could actually be substantially larger or smaller in other situations. The importance of the model lies in making it clear what characteristics of the research area have to be specified to make a principled argument for using one $\alpha$ level rather than another, and the model thereby provides a blueprint for researchers seeking to justify a particular $\alpha$ level.},

He has spent more time in “Indian country,” as it is officially known by the federal government, than any other president. Moreover, he has implemented an annual Tribal Nations Conference to facilitate consultation between the federal government and Indigenous leadership. In this article, the author argues that Obama's discourse of Indigenous issues is marked by a particular form of rhetoric, constitutive rhetoric, through which he calls into existence a new, inclusive relationship between the United States and tribal governments. Focusing primarily on his speeches at Tribal Nations Conferences, the author identifies a “nations-within” concept adhered to by Obama that contrasts markedly with past presidential rhetoric concerning Indigenous Americans.},

Multiple hierarchical regression analyses revealed significant positive main effects of minority stress factors and state ballot status on psychological distress. In addition, the association between amendment-related affect and psychological distress was significantly higher in states that had passed a marriage amendment compared with other states. Discussion of these findings emphasizes that marriage amendments create an environ- ment associated with negative psychological outcomes for LGB individuals.},

abstract = {Some Americans are changing the way they pair up, but others aren't satisfied with pairs. In the last few years, while voters, legislatures, and judiciaries have expanded marriage in favor of same-sex couples, some are hoping for expansion in a different dimension. These Americans, instead of concerning themselves with gender restrictions, want to remove numerical restrictions on marriage currently imposed by states. These people call themselves polyamorists, and they are seeking rights for their multiple-partner relationships. Of course, polygamy is nothing new for the human species. Some scientists believe that polygamy is actually the most natural human relationship, and history is littered with a variety of approaches to polygamous relations. Only in recent centuries has society's preference for monogamy developed, yet that preference has proven robust, as most Western governments vehemently support monogamy as the only marital option. This Comment explores polygyny and polyamory in the United States and walks through the traditional legal, political, and sociological arguments for and against polygamy. While most polygamy throughout the world stems from cultural or religious bases, this Comment primarily focuses on freely entered-into polygamy. The traditional human rights arguments against cultural- and religious-based polygamy do not necessarily apply to coercion-free polyamory. While some claim the absence of coercion leaves the state without a compelling reason to ban polygamous marriage, this Comment disagrees and finds several compelling reasons for states to favor monogamy. Alarmingly, in the face of challenges by would-be polygamous couples, states are unable to articulate exactly what interest they have in normative monogamy. Attorneys defending states' polygamy laws usually rely on historical or administrative reasons, essentially claiming that monogamy should hold because that's what we have always done, and it would be too hard to change. These typical arguments sell monogamy short. This Comment proposes other, more dynamic reasons that states should continue to support normative monogamy, reasons that have thus far been ignored by the legal world. Normative monogamy plays a far greater role in the development of Western society than states have argued. In fact, social science research shows that normative monogamy makes members of society more productive by encouraging long-term investments instead of short-term, mating-focused expenditures of resources. This natural shift in priorities among the monogamous has led to radical advancement in societies that practice normative monogamy. Monogamy's contribution to society has been largely ignored by the legal world and unargued before courts deciding the merits of laws proscribing polygamy; yet normative monogamy's role in the advancement of society is the single most compelling interest that states have. This Comment advances that previously ignored interest. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {I use readability scores to test if women are held to higher standards in academic peer review. I find: (i) female-authored papers are 1–6 percent better written than equivalent papers by men; (ii) the gap is almost two times higher in published arti-cles than in earlier, draft versions of the same papers; (iii) women's writing gradually improves but men's does not—meaning the readability gap grows over authors' ca-reers. Within a subjective expected utility framework, I exploit authors' decisions to show that tougher editorial standards and/or biased referee assignment are uniquely consistent with the observed pattern of choices. A conservative causal estimate de-rived from the model suggests senior female economists write at least 9 percent more clearly than they otherwise would. I then document evidence that higher standards affect behaviour and lower productivity. First, female-authored papers take half a year longer in peer review. Second, as women update beliefs about referees' stan-dards, they increasingly meet those standards before peer review. The latter response disguises external thresholds as personal choice; the former reduces women's output. Both whitewash discrimination. More generally, tougher standards impose a quanti-ty/quality tradeoff that characterises many instances of female output. They could re-solve persistently lower—otherwise unexplained—female productivity in many high-skill occupations. * This paper is a revised version of the third chapter of my dissertation (University of Cambridge, September 2015).

Guided by previous literature related to prejudice and discrimination experiences and psychological distress in trans populations, this study explored depression, substance use, and alcohol use as mediators of the relations of minority stressors and social support with suicide. Results suggested that depression fully mediated the relations of experiences of prejudice and discrimination and friend support with suicide, while it partially mediated the relation of internalized anti-trans attitudes with suicide. Fear of anti-trans stigma and family support did not have unique direct or mediated relations with suicide, and were not uniquely related to depression, substance use, or alcohol use. Alcohol use and substance use also did not mediate the relations of any minority stressors or social support variables with suicide. An alternative model where social support mediated the relations of minority stressors with depression, alcohol use, and substance use was also explored, but was not found to be a significant improvement. Finally, the pattern of relations among study variables between trans subgroups (i.e., trans men, trans women, gender nonconforming) was explored, and the resultant model was not significantly different between groups.},

Comparing workers' earnings reports in the U.S. Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to their detailed W-2 earnings records from the Social Security Administration, we employ ordinary least squares (OLS) and quantile regression models to assess the effects of earnings determinants and demographic variables on measurement errors in 2004 SIPP earnings in terms of bias and variance. Results show that measurement errors in earnings are not classical, but mean-reverting. The directions of bias for subpopulations are not constant, but varying across levels of earnings. Highly educated workers more correctly report their earnings than less educated workers at higher earnings levels, but they tend to overreport at lower earnings levels. Black workers with high earnings underreport to a greater degree than comparable whites, while black workers with low earnings overreport to a greater degree. Some subpopulations exhibit higher variances of measurement errors than others. Blacks, Hispanics, high school dropouts, part-year employed workers, and occupation “switchers” tend to misreport—both over- and underreport—their earnings rather than unilaterally in one direction. The implications of our findings are discussed.},

Second, our results are consistent with a model of customer discrimination: The racial and ethnic composition of the center's customer base is correlated with the characteristics of job seekers receiving an interview.

Four hundred employers completed telephone interviews in which they were asked to evaluate the relative productivity and cost of white-collar and rank-and-file workers aged 55 and older and whether, on balance, older employees or job candidates were more or less attractive than their younger counterparts. Survey results reveal that very few employers said workers aged 55 and older were less productive than younger workers; age was actually a significant advantage in white-collar jobs. The only significant negative assessment was that 20{\%} reported that older rank-and-file workers were less productive. Evaluations of the relative productivity of older workers varied among employers grouped by industry, number of employees, and defined benefit coverage. About 40{\%} of employers reported that older workers are more expensive than someone younger, twice as many as said older workers cost less. Large employers were far more likely to see older workers as relatively costly. Two-thirds of the employers said an older employee or prospect is neither more nor less attractive than someone younger. The key result of the survey is that older workers have reasonably good prospects for extending their working careers.

abstract = {Discrimination is an acute and chronic stressor that negatively impacts the health of many ethnic groups in the United States. Individuals who perceive increased levels of discrimination are at risk of experiencing psychological distress and symptoms of depression. No study to date has examined the relationship between perceived discrimination and mental health in Native Hawaiians. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between perceived discrimination and depression based on the Homestead Health Survey mailed to Native Hawaiian residents of Hawaiian Home Lands. This study also explores the role of cultural identity and how it may impact experiences of discrimination and symptoms of depression. Based on cross-sectional data obtained from 104 Native Hawaiian residents, a significant positive correlation was found between perceived discrimination and symptoms of depression (r= 0.32, P{\textless}.001). Cultural identity did not significantly correlate with discrimination or depression. Multiple linear regression analyses indicate that the relationship between depression and discrimination remained statistically significant (coefficient estimate of 0.18; P{\textless}.01), after accounting for differences in socio-demographics and degree of identification with the Native Hawaiian and American cultures. These findings are consistent with other studies that have focused on the effects of discrimination on psychological wellbeing for other ethnic minority populations.},

However, their dense parameterization leads to unstable inference and inaccurate out-of-sample forecasts, particularly for models with many variables. A solution to this problem is to use informative pri- ors in order to shrink the richly parameterized unrestricted model toward a parsimonious naıve benchmark, and thus reduce estimation uncertainty. This paper studies the optimal choice of the informativeness of these priors, which we treat as additional parameters, in the spirit of hierarchical model- ing. This approach, theoretically grounded and easy to implement, greatly reduces the number and importance of subjective choices in the setting of the prior. Moreover, it performs very well in terms of both out-of-sample forecasting—as well as factor models—and accuracy in the estimation of impulse response functions.},

abstract = {This paper introduces large-T bias-corrected estimators for nonlinear panel data models with both time invariant and time varying heterogeneity. These models include systems of equations with limited dependent variables and unobserved individual effects, and sample selection models with unobserved individual effects. Our two-step approach first estimates the reduced form by fixed effects procedures to obtain estimates of the time varying heterogeneity underlying the endogeneity/selection bias. We then estimate the primary equation by fixed effects including an appropriately constructed control variable from the reduced form estimates as an additional explanatory variable. The fixed effects approach in this second step captures the time invariant heterogeneity while the control variable accounts for the time varying heterogeneity. Since either or both steps might employ nonlinear fixed effects procedures it is necessary to bias adjust the estimates due to the incidental parameters problem. This problem is exacerbated by the two-step nature of the procedure. As these two-step approaches are not covered in the existing literature we derive the appropriate correction thereby extending the use of large-T bias adjustments to an important class of models. Simulation evidence indicates our approach works well in finite samples and an empirical example illustrates the applicability of our estimator. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Lossbroek2020,
abstract = {This article analyses old-age discrimination in managers' hypothetical hiring decisions. We expect that older job candidates are less likely to be hired than equally qualified younger candidates. Statistical discrimination theory argues that when recruiters have more information about the candidate's skills, age is less important for hiring decisions. Given inconclusive results of previous studies, we elaborate on the theory by focusing on the content rather than the amount of information. We argue that information is primarily influential if it debunks, rather than confirms, ageist stereotypes. To test this argument, a factorial survey was conducted among 482 managers in nine European countries. The findings show that older candidates indeed receive lower hireability scores, and this finding is robust across countries and sectors. However, we do not find that stereotype-rejecting information moderates age discrimination: it does not matter whether recruiters have information that debunks or confirms ageist stereotypes; age is equally important in both situations. Our findings suggest that for hiring decisions, the valuation of applicants' skills and their age are largely independent.},

abstract = {We examine whether exposure of men to women in a traditionally male-dominated environment can change attitudes about mixed-gender productivity, gender roles and gender identity. Our context is the military in Norway, where we randomly assigned female recruits to some squads but not others during boot camp. We find that living and working with women for 8 weeks causes men to adopt more egalitarian attitudes. There is a 14 percentage point increase in the fraction of men who think mixed-gender teams perform as well or better than same-gender teams, an 8 percentage point increase in men who think household work should be shared equally and a 14 percentage point increase in men who do not completely disavow feminine traits. Contrary to the predictions of many policymakers, we find no evidence that integrating women into squads hurt male recruits' satisfaction with boot camp or their plans to continue in the military. These findings provide evidence that even in a highly gender-skewed environment, gender stereotypes are malleable and can be altered by integrating members of the opposite sex.},

We find areas that border or are economically similar to EZ locations experience a decline in the number of establishments and employment compared to areas that border or are similar to rejected EZ applicants. We also demonstrate that using spillover prone areas to estimate program effects causes upward bias when the spillover is negative.

That is surprising because several popular trade books have recently appeared condemning teaching practices at American colleges and universities. Some of these books were written by economists and used economics courses as notable examples of these problems. In early 1995 a five-page questionnaire was mailed to 3,059 individuals selected either as academic members of the American Economic Association or as college teachers of economics listed in the College Marketing Guide. Authors calculated two average measures, medians and means, and the sample standard deviation of responses for which a number-line measurement is meaningful. Before discussing survey results in more detail, however, several caveats are in order. Instructors at associate colleges reported teaching an average of five courses per semester, or four per quarter, while at research universities the average was two per semester.},

First, we distinguish among and find evidence for four mechanisms of policy diffusion: learning from earlier adopters, economic competition among proximate cities, imitation of larger cities, and coercion by state governments. Second, we find a temporal component to these effects, with imitation being a more short-lived diffusion process than the others. Third, we show that these mechanisms are conditional,with larger cities being better able to learn fromothers, less fearful of economic spillovers, and less likely to rely on imitation.},

One such violent incident took place in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1979, when Klansmen killed five Communist demonstrators. Greensboro's Truth and Reconciliation Commission was created in 2004 as an intervention into collective memory of the killings. In this article, I draw on a unique survey of 716 respondents about this case to make three arguments. First, I argue that memory projects can induce mnemonic overlap between creators and audiences, modestly stimulating support for redress of historic injustice. Second, I show that while “preaching to the choir” and to undecided audiences is effective, building project awareness among ideological opponents triggers increased resistance, not persuasion. Third, I show that audiences filtered the project's story through its key characters' ingrained reputations, especially that of the Ku Klux Klan, which constrained and enabled the Commission's effectiveness in surprising ways. I discuss implications for commemorative projects as a part of redress.},

Even after controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, health care access, and physical and mental health, perceived discrimination was associated with underutilization of medical care among Whites, U.S.-born Blacks, and American Indians and was associated with underutilization of mental health care among Whites, U.S.-born Blacks, Southeast Asians, and American Indians. Correlates of different types of discrimination (major, everyday, health care) on underutilization of care varied among ethnic groups. The higher prevalence of discrimination among racial and ethnic minorities may contribute to their underutilization of health care services. Future research is needed to understand the impacts of different types of discrimination on different groups.},

abstract = {People in open and other consensually nonmonogamous partnerships have been historically underserved by researchers and providers. Many studies group such partnerships together with nonconsensual nonmonogamy (NCNM) under the banner of “concurrent sexual partnerships.” Discrimination from service providers poses a substantial barrier to care. Responding to such concerns, this investigation explored sociodemographic correlates with open relationships and associations between relationship structure and sexual risk, HIV/STI testing, and relationship satisfaction in a nationally representative probability sample. Data were drawn from the 2012 National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior (n = 2270). We used multinomial logistic regression to identify correlates with relationship structure, and linear and logistic regression to investigate associations between relationship structure and testing, condom use, and relationship satisfaction. Eighty-nine percent of participants reported monogamy, 4{\%} reported open relationships, and 8{\%} reported NCNM. Males, gay/lesbian individuals, bisexual individuals, and those who identified as “Other, Non-Hispanic” were more likely to report open relationships. Bisexual individuals and Black, Non-Hispanic participants were more likely to report NCNM; older participants were less likely to do so. Participants in open relationships reported more frequent condom use for anal intercourse and lower relationship satisfaction than monogamous participants. NCNM participants reported more HIV testing and lower satisfaction. Identities, experiences, and behaviors within open and other consensually nonmonogamous populations should be regarded as unique and diverse, rather than conflated with those common to other relationship structures. There is a need for greater awareness of diverse relationship structures among researchers and providers, and incorporation of related content into educational programming.},

Yet most empirical discrimination research treats race no differently than other individual characteristics typically observed in data. This article considers the implications of adopting a constructivist perspective instead. I develop a simple model where agents use observable characteristics to both interpret membership in racial social categories and make decisions. Discrimination is the result of acting based on perceived social identity. The model highlights the need to measure the racial first stage-the social identity contrast between individuals-instead of relying on race as coded in data, and draws a novel distinction between race-based and direct statistical discrimination. I illustrate some implications using data on wages, speech patterns, and skin color, and conclude with strategies for future research that build on the constructivist model.},

Information is acquired through previous experience with wetlands and through the contingent market. Households which are unaware of substitute or complement environmental goods when participating in contingent markets may overstate or understate willingness to pay values. This paper estimates willingness to pay for preservation of the Clear Creek wetland in western Kentucky when faced with surface coal mining. We test for the effects of explicit information about related environmental goods on contingent values by measuring the difference in stated willingness to pay. Willingness to pay for preservation of the Clear Creek wetland decreases with information about surface coal mine lake reclamation and, in the initial, independent format increases with information about a nearby publicly owned, wetland area. These findings suggest that the lack of explicit information about related environmental goods in contingent markets can contribute to a misstatement of willingness to pay.},

Three paths can lead from racial bias to poorer health among Black Americans. First is the already well-documented physical and psychological toll of being a target of persistent discrimination. Second, implicit bias can affect physicians' perceptions and decisions, creating racial disparities in medical treatments, although evidence is mixed. The third path describes a less direct route: Physicians' implicit racial bias negatively affects communication and the patient–provider relationship, resulting in racial disparities in the outcomes of medical interactions. Strong evidence shows that physician implicit bias negatively affects Black patients' reactions to medical interactions, and there is good circumstantial evidence that these reactions affect health outcomes of the interactions.

This paper tests the hypothesis (based on Becker 1957) that increased competition resulting from globalization in the 1980s forced employers to reduce costly discrimination against women. The empirical strategy exploits differences in market structure across industries to identify the impact of trade on the gender wage gap: because concentrated industries face little competitive pressure to reduce discrimination, an increase in competition from increased trade should lead to a reduction in the gender wage gap. We compare the change in the residual gender wage gap between 1976 and 1993 in concentrated versus competitive manufacturing industries, using the latter as a control for changes in the gender wage gap that are unrelated to competitive pressures. We find that increased competition through trade did contribute to the relative improvement in female wages in concentrated relative to competitive industries, suggesting that, at least in this sense, trade may benefit women by reducing firms' ability to discriminate.},

The model suggests that the stereotype is automatically activated in the presence of a member (or some symbolic equivalent) of the stereotyped group and that Iow-prejudiee responses require controlled inhibition of the automatically activated stereotype. Study 2, which examined the effects of auto- marie stereotype activation on the evaluation of ambiguous stereotype-relevant behaviors performed by a race-unspecified person, suggested that when subjects' ability to consciously monitor stereotype activation is precluded, both high- and low-prejudice subjects produce stereotype-congruent evalua- tions of ambiguous behaviors. Study 3 examined high- and low-prejudice subjects' responses in a consciously directed thought-listing task. Consistent with the model, only low-prejudice subjects inhibited the automatically activated stereotype-congruent thoughts and replaced them with thoughts reflecting equality and negations of the stereotype. The relation between stereotypes and prejudice and implications for prejudice reduction are discussed.},

Unlike most previouswork,we use the firmas the lens of analysis to account for greater heterogeneity and the fact that many skilled immigrant admissions are driven by firms themselves (e.g., the H-1B visa).OLS and IV specifications show rising overall employment of skilled workers with increased skilled immigrant employment by the firm. Employment expansion is greater for young natives than for their older counterparts. The departure rates for older workers relative to younger workers appear highest for those in STEM occupations.},

In typical social science practice, this decision often involves consideration of whether to send single or multiple auditors to test for discrimination at a site that represents the unit of analysis, such as employers, landlords, or schools. In this chapter, we provide tools for researchers considering the statistical and substantive implications of this decision. For the former, we show how sample size and statistical efficiency questions hinge in large part on the expected concordance of outcomes when testers are sent to the same unit or site. For the latter, we encourage researchers to think carefully about what is gained and lost via matched and non-matched designs, particularly regarding the finite nature of certain populations, resource constraints, and the likelihood of detection in the field. For both approaches, we make recommendations for the appropriate statistical analysis in light of the given design and direct readers to software and code that may be helpful in informing design choices. 2},

We aimed to describe gender differences in pain experiences and treatment, specifically the use of opioids and benzodiazepines after ED discharge, for MVC-related pain. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of previously collected data from the CRASH Injury studies. We included patients who were seen and discharged from an ED after an MVC and who were enrolled in 1 of 2 multicenter longitudinal prospective cohort studies (1 black/non-Hispanic and 1 white/non-Hispanic). First, we compared the experience of pain as defined by self-reported moderate-to-severe axial pain, widespread pain, number of somatic symptoms, pain catastrophizing, and peritraumatic distress between women and men using bivariate analyses. We then determined whether there were gender differences in the receipt of prescription medications for post-MVC pain symptoms (opioids and benzodiazepines) using multivariate logistic regression adjusting for demographic characteristics, pain, and collision characteristics. Findings: In total, 1878 patients were included: 61.4{\%} were women. More women reported severe symptoms on the pain catastrophizing scale (36.8{\%} vs 31.0{\%}; P = 0.032) and peritraumatic distress following the MVC (59.7{\%} vs 42.5{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001), and women reported more somatic symptoms than men (median, 3.9; interquartile range, 3.7-4.0 vs median, 3.3; interquartile range, 3.1-3.5; P {\textless} 0.001). Unadjusted, similar proportions of women and men were given opioids (29.2{\%} vs 29.7{\%}; P = 0.84). After adjusting for covariates, women and men remained equally likely to receive a prescription for opioids (relative risk = 0.83; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.58–1.19). Women were less likely than men to receive a benzodiazepine at discharge from an ED (relative risk = 0.53; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.32–0.88). Implications: In a large, multicenter study of ED patients treated for MVC, there were gender differences in the acute psychological response to MVC with women reporting more psychological and somatic symptoms. Women and men were equally likely to receive opioid prescriptions at discharge. Future research should investigate potential gender-specific interventions to reduce both posttraumatic distress and the risk of developing negative long-term outcomes like chronic pain.},

We investigate these issues in the metropolitan area of Vancouver, Canada, through analysis of 1,669 inquiries made about one- and two-bedroom apartments. Using a field experimental design similar to audit studies, we analyze landlord responses to five dif- ferent two-person household scenarios, including one heterosexual couple, two same-sex couples, and two single parents. Evidence suggests that male same-sex couples, single mothers, and single fathers all face significant discrimination relative to heterosexual couples. The contact hypothesis was supported for male same-sex couples, but not for single parents. This could indicate that single parents are facing discrimination primarily based upon their economic marginalization rather than other forms of prejudice},

The purpose of this study was to examine how licensed mental health clinicians' perceptions of clients were influenced by a hypothetical client's social class and sexual orientation using a 2 (lower social class vs. higher social class) × 2 (lesbian vs. straight) quasi-experimental vignette-based design. Results from 257 practitioners demonstrated that the hypothetical client portrayed in the video was rated differently on levels of depression, anxiety, and flourishing, as well as job satisfaction and meaningful work. Participants who viewed the client portrayed as having a lower social class rated her as having more symptoms of depression and anxiety, as being less satisfied at work, as having lower levels of meaningful work, and as having lower levels of flourishing as compared with the participants who viewed the client portrayed as having a higher social class. Participants did not rate the hypothetical clients differently on symptoms of depression, anxiety, meaningful work, or job satisfaction based upon client sexual orientation. The lesbian client was rated as being significantly more attractive to work with and as having significantly higher levels of flourishing as compared to the straight clients. No interaction effects were demonstrated. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).},

We discuss the structure of this group—as well as a survey-based assessment of it—to demonstrate how this approach can be readily adopted by other women in the profession who seek to expand their network of mentors to include peers in their subfield.},

abstract = {In two online field-experiments (N₁ = 336, N₂ = 456) we investigated the effects of belonging to an ethnic minority, a sexual minority, or to both minority groups simultaneously on rental discrimination in Germany. We predicted that a Turkish heterosexual couple and a German gay male couple would receive fewer replies to their inquiries about a rental offering and fewer invitations for viewings than a German heterosexual couple. We also predicted that the intersection of two stigmatized identities would have beneficial effects and thus result in less discrimination of the Turkish gay male couple compared to the Turkish heterosexual couple. Chi-square tests revealed evidence of rental discrimination based on ethnicity, but not for discrimination based on sexual orientation; no evidence for beneficial effects of the intersection of two stigmatized identities was found. Implications for future research on discrimination of ethnic and sexual minorities are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Mental health status was assessed by psychological distress and depression. In cross-sectional analyses, the perception of racial discrimination was related to high levels of psychological distress at Waves 2 and 3. Experiencing racial discrimination was marginally related to a high likelihood of depression at Wave 2. In longitudinal analyses, reports of racial discrimination at Wave 2 were associated with high levels of psychological distress at Wave 3. High psychological distress or depression at Wave 2 was not associated with reports of racial discrimination at Wave 3—indicating that poor mental health did not predict subjective reports (perceptions) of discrimination. The Discussion focused on possible directions for a more comprehensive program of research on mental health, stress, and experiences of racially based discrimination.},

abstract = {We provide the first evidence on the relationship between disability programs and markers of financial distress: bankruptcy, foreclosure, eviction, and home sale. Rates of these adverse financial events peak around the time of disability application and subsequently fall for both allowed and denied applicants. To estimate the causal effect of disability programs on these outcomes, we use variation induced by an age-based eligibility rule and find that disability allowance substantially reduces the likelihood of adverse financial events. Within three years of the decision, the likelihood of bankruptcy falls by 0.81 percentage point (30 percent), and the likelihood of foreclosure and home sale among homeowners falls by 1.7 percentage points (30 percent) and 2.5 percentage points (20 percent), respectively. We find suggestive evidence of reductions in eviction rates. Conversely, the likelihood of home purchases increases by 0.86 percentage point (20 percent) within three years. We present evidence that these changes reflect true reductions in financial distress. In our model of optimal disability benefits, considering these extreme events increases optimal disability benefits and potentially shortens waiting times.},

We study the dynamics of residential electricity demand by exploiting price variation arising from a natural experiment: the introduction of an Illinois policy that enabled communities to select electricity suppliers on behalf of their residents. Participating communities experienced average price decreases in excess of 10 percent in the two years following adoption. Using a flexible difference-in-differences matching approach, we estimate a one-year price elasticity of -0.14 and three-year elasticity of -0.29. We also present evidence that consumers increased usage in anticipation of the price changes. Finally, we estimate a forward-looking demand model and project that the price elasticity converges to a value between -0.30 and -0.35 after ten years. Our findings demonstrate the importance of accounting for long-run dynamics in this context.},

Finally, employers who are familiar with online education (i.e., have taken online courses themselves) are more likely to hire an online graduate, rate online education as more rigorous, and perceive a greater potential for soft skill attainment in the online environment (albeit with preference still towards traditional applicants), as opposed to those employers without online education experience.},

From 1890 to 1940, ghettos were born as blacks migrated to urban areas and cities developed vast expanses filled with almost entirely black housing. From 1940 to 1970, black migration continued and the physical areas of the ghettos expanded. Since 1970, there has been a decline in segregation as blacks have moved into previously all-white areas of cities and suburbs. Across all these time periods there is a strong positive relation between urban population or density and segregation. Data on house prices and attitudes toward integration suggest that in the mid-twentieth century, segregation was a product of collective actions taken by whites to exclude blacks from their neighborhoods. By 1990, the legal barriers enforcing segregation had been replaced by decentralized racism, where whites pay more than blacks to live in predominantly white areas.},

By comparing the call-back rates of Latino minority and majority group applicants, we measure the labour market discrimination that Latinos experience in these two national contexts. Due to their proximity in terms of culture and language, Latinos are expected to experience less discrimination in Spain than in the US. This is supported by our findings, as the level of discrimination against Latinos in the US is high and statistically significant, while we find no evidence of statistically significant discrimination against Latinos in Spain. In line with research on the intersection between ethnicity and gender in stereotyping, we find gender differences regarding discrimination in both countries, though in opposite directions. While Latino males are more discriminated than Latino females in the US, Latino females experience more discrimination than their male counterparts in Spain, who are not treated differently from Spanish native men. Our results indicate that ethnic group stereotypes are country-specific and different for males and females of the same ethnicity. Moreover, we find partial evidence that ethnic group stereotypes can be counteracted when favourable information on warmth and competence is provided.},

IATs were poor predictors of every criterion category other than brain activity, and the IATs performed no better than simple explicit measures. These results have important implications for the construct validity of IATs, for competing theories of prejudice and attitude-behavior relations, and for measuring and modeling prejudice and discrimination.},

abstract = {The U.S. Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) with an unusual degree of political consensus and popular support.  The ADA broadly prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in employment and other settings.  Given the breadth of the political support for the ADA, it was perhaps surprising to find early evidence that the law actually worsened rather than improved employment prospects for individuals with disabilities.  Variation in state-level employment discrimination regimes for individuals with disabilities in the period before the ADA enactment provides a helpful means of cutting through the existing thicket and identifying more credibly the effects of the ADA on outcomes, in terms of both employment and decisions about educational investments.  The degree to which the ADA employment discrimination provisions were an innovation relative to pre-ADA state law is closely connected to the degree to which disabled employment declined just after the ADA passage.  As in the context of the ADA employment effects, examining the ADA impact on disabled educational participation across states, with versus without preexisting ADA-like employment discrimination regimes, helps to control for general changes in incentives for disabled educational participation that may have occurred with the ADA enactment.},

abstract = {An important line of research using laboratory experiments has provided a new potential reason for gender imbalances in labour markets: men are more competitively inclined than women. Whether, and to what extent, gender differences in attitudes toward competition lead to differences in naturally occurring labour markets remains an open question. To examine this, we run a natural field experiment on job-entry decisions where we randomize almost 9000 job-seekers into different compensation regimes. By varying the role that individual competition plays in setting the wage and the gender composition, we examine whether a competitive compensation regime, by itself, can cause differential job entry. The data highlight the power of the compensation regime in that women disproportionately shy away from competitive work settings. Yet, there are important factors that attenuate the gender differences, including whether the job is performed in teams, whether the position has overt gender associations, and the age of the job-seekers. We also find that the effect is most pronounced in labour markets with attractive alternative employment options. Furthermore, our results suggest that preferences over uncertainty can be just as important as preferences over competition per se in driving job-entry choices.},

Our results indicate that there is considerable segregation by race, ethnicity, education, and language in the workplace. Only a tiny portion of racial segregation in the workplace is driven by education differences between blacks and whites, but a substantial fraction of ethnic segregation in the workplace can be attributed to differences in English-language proficiency. Finally, additional evidence suggests that segregation by language likely reflects complementarity among workers speaking the same language.

We test for policy complementarities between these reforms and demand-side efforts to deter age discrimination, specifically studying whether stronger state-level age discrimination protections enhanced the impact of the 1983 Social Security reforms that increased the full retirement age (FRA) and reduced benefits. The evidence indicates that, for older individuals for whom early retirement benefits fell and the FRA increased, stronger state age discrimination protections were associated with delayed benefit claiming and increases in employment, with benefit claiming pushed from 65 to the new FRA, and increased employment after age 62 and age 65 that is then curtailed at the new FRA. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

However, a moral hazard effect can arise if the existence of the laws leads black employees to bring unjustified claims of discrimination against employers. It has been argued that employers may become more reluctant to hire black workers for fear of being subjected to frivolous lawsuits. Using the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality (MCSUI), we find that male and female black workers are far more likely than whites to report racial discrimination at work. This is the case even when a host of human capital and labor market factors are controlled for. Further, nearly all black workers who report they have been discriminated against on the job in the MCSUI Surveys also show statistical evidence of wage discrimination. This is not the case for white males or females. We find little evidence to support a moral hazard effect. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

We build a general large-sample likelihood apparatus in which limiting distributions and risk properties of estimators post-selection as well as of model average estimators are precisely described, also explicitly taking modeling bias into account. This allows a drastic reduction in complexity, as competing model averaging schemes may be developed, discussed, and compared inside a statistical prototype experiment where only a few crucial quantities matter. In particular, we offer a frequentist view on Bayesian model averaging methods and give a link to generalized ridge estimators. Our work also leads to new model selection criteria.

abstract = {Given their capacity to identify causal relationships, experimental audit studies have grown increasingly popular in the social sciences. Typically, investigators send fictitious auditors who differ by a key factor (e.g., race) to particular experimental units (e.g., employers) and then compare treatment and control groups on a dichotomous outcome (e.g., hiring). In such scenarios, an important design consideration is the power to detect a certain magnitude difference between the groups. But power calculations are not straightforward in standard matched tests for dichotomous outcomes. Given the paired nature of the data, the number of pairs in the concordant cells (when neither or both auditor receives a positive response) contributes to the power, which is lower as the sum of the discordant proportions approaches one. Because these quantities are difficult to determine a priori, researchers must exercise particular care in experimental design. We here present sample size and power calculations for McNemar's test using empirical data from an audit study on misdemeanor arrest records and employability. We then provide formulas and examples for cases involving more than two treatments (Cochran's Q test) and nominal outcomes (Stuart–Maxwell test). We conclude with concrete recommendations concerning power and sample size for researchers designing and presenting matched audit studies.},

I analyze the properties of the traditional DiD estimator conditional on having passed (i.e. not rejected) the test for parallel pre-trends. When the DiD design is valid and the test for pre-trends confirms it, the typical DiD estimator is unbiased, but traditional standard errors are overly conservative. Additionally, there exists an alternative unbiased estimator that is more efficient than the traditional DiD estimator under parallel trends. However, when in population there is a non-zero pre-trend but we fail to reject the hypothesis of parallel pre-trends, the DiD estimator is generally biased relative to the population DiD coefficient. Moreover, if the trend is monotone, then under reasonable assumptions the bias from conditioning exacerbates the bias relative to the true treatment effect. I propose new estimation and inference procedures that account for the test for parallel trends, and compare their performance to that of the traditional estimator in a Monte Carlo simulation.},

The experiment was performed for three different scenarios in which the probability of treatment was (1) unrelated to pre-intervention performance; (2) positively correlated with pre-intervention levels of performance; and (3) positively correlated with pre-intervention trends in performance. We estimated alternative DID models that varied with respect to the choice of data intervals, the comparison group, and the method of obtaining inference. We assessed estimator bias as the mean absolute deviation between estimated program effects and their true value. We evaluated the accuracy of inferences through statistical power and rates of false rejection of the null hypothesis. Principal Findings Performance of alternative specifications varied dramatically when the probability of treatment was correlated with pre-intervention levels or trends. In these cases, propensity score matching resulted in much more accurate point estimates. The use of permutation tests resulted in lower false rejection rates for the highly biased estimators, but the use of clustered standard errors resulted in slightly lower false rejection rates for the matching estimators. Conclusions When treatment and comparison groups differed on pre-intervention levels or trends, our results supported specifications for DID models that include matching for more accurate point estimates and models using clustered standard errors or permutation tests for better inference. Based on our findings, we propose a checklist for DID analysis.},

abstract = {When jobs offered by different employers are not perfect substitutes, employers gain wage-setting power; the extent of this power can be captured by the elasticity of labor supply to the firm. The authors collect 1,320 estimates of this parameter from 53 studies. Findings show a prominent discrepancy between estimates of direct elasticity of labor supply to changes in wage (smaller) and the estimates converted from inverse elasticities (larger), suggesting that labor market institutions may rein in a substantial amount of firm wage-setting power. This gap remains after they control for 22 additional variables and use Bayesian Model Averaging and LASSO to address model uncertainty; however, it is less pronounced for studies employing an identification strategy. Furthermore, the authors find strong evidence that implies the literature on direct estimates is prone to selective reporting: Negative estimates of the elasticity of labor supply to the firm tend to be discarded, leading to upward bias in the mean reported estimate. Additionally, they point out several socioeconomic factors that seem to affect the degree of monopsony power.},

Recent evidence using Implicit Association Tests suggests that these disparities in outcome may in part be due to social biases that are primarily unconscious. In some individuals the activation of these biases may be also facilitated by the high levels of cognitive load associated with clinical practice. However, a range of measures, such as counter-stereotypical stimuli and targeted experience with minority groups, have been identified as possible solutions in other fields and may be adapted for use within healthcare settings. We suggest that social bias should not be seen exclusively as a problem of conscious attitudes which need to be addressed through increased awareness. Instead the delivery of bias free healthcare should become a habit, developed through a continuous process of practice, feedback and reflection.},

The empirical study shows that older workers aged 55 years and over who are members of New Zealand's largest union and employers who belong to the New Zealand Employers' Federation hold in common a number of stereotypes about older workers. The negative stereotypes held by both groups are “adaptability factors”, such as resistance to change and problems with technology, particularly computer technology. The positive stereotypes also relate to “adaptability factors”, but in this case they are reliability, loyalty and job commitment. The implications of the findings are considered for the Government's policy on positive ageing and for societal change.},

They find a shift from primary reliance on business incentives to use of a broader set of strategies that includes business retention and small business support. The authors also find evidence of policy learning with increased attention to accountability among governments that use business incentives. The 2004 model results also suggest that governments that rely most heavily on incentives may face more intergovernmental competition, stagnating or declining economies, and lower tax bases. For such governments, business incentives may contribute to a cycle of destructive competition.},

abstract = {Disparities in health care associated with patients' gender, race, and age are well documented. Previous studies using virtual human (VH) technology have demonstrated that provider characteristics may play an important role in pain management decisions. However, these studies have largely emphasized group differences. The aims of this study were to examine dentists' and physicians' use of VH characteristics when making clinical judgments (i.e., cue use) and to identify provider characteristics associated with the magnitude of the impact of these cues ($\beta$-weights). Providers (N=152; 76 physicians, 76 dentists) viewed video vignettes of VH patients varying in gender (male/female), race (white/black), and age (younger/older). Participants rated VH patients' pain intensity and unpleasantness and then rated their own likelihood of administering non-opioid and opioid analgesics. Compared to physicians, dentists had significantly lower $\beta$-weights associated with VH age cues for all ratings (p{\textless}0.001; d{\textgreater}0.69). These effects varied by provider race and gender. For pain intensity, professional differences were present only among non-white providers. White providers had greater $\beta$-weights than non-white providers for pain unpleasantness but only among men. Provider differences regarding the use of VH age cues in non-opioid analgesic administration were present among all providers except non-white males. These findings highlight the interaction of patient and provider factors in driving clinical decision making. Although profession was related to use of VH age cues in pain-related clinical judgments, this relationship was modified by providers' personal characteristics. Additional research is needed to understand what aspects of professional training or practice may account for differences between physicians and dentists and what forms of continuing education may help to mitigate the disparities.},

In polls inquiring about communion (e.g., affectionate, emotional), agency (e.g., ambitious, courageous), and competence (e.g., intelligent, creative), respondents indicated whether each trait is more true of women or men, or equally true of both. Women's relative advantage in communion increased over time, but men's relative advantage in agency showed no change. Belief in competence equality increased over time, along with belief in female superiority among those who indicated a sex difference in competence. Contemporary gender stereotypes thus convey substantial female advantage in communion and a smaller male advantage in agency but also gender equality in competence along with some female advantage. Interpretation emphasizes the origins of gender stereotypes in the social roles of women and men.},

abstract = {This article examines match bias arising from earnings imputation. Wage equation parameters are estimated from mixed samples of workers reporting and not reporting earnings, the latter assigned earnings of donors. Regressions including attributes not used as imputation match criteria (e.g., union) are severely biased. Match bias also arises with attributes used as match criteria but matched imperfectly. Imperfect matching on schooling (age) flattens earnings profiles within education (age) groups and creates jumps across groups. Assuming conditional missing at random, a general analytic expression correcting match bias is derived and compared to alternatives. Reweighting a respondent‐only sample proves an attractive approach. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 2006 The University of Chicago},

The findings indicate a complex set of relationships, and challenge the simplistic causal link between attitudes and practice. The conclusions discuss the implications of these findings for the future employment of older workers, and assess the extent to which the forthcoming age discrimination legislation in the UK is likely to tackle discriminatory attitudes, practices and policies.},

However, anecdotes of bureaucratic noncompliance (in the form of bias or denial of license issuance) raise the possibility that de jure marriage equality has not led to equality in practice. We investigate this by conducting a nationwide audit experiment of local-level marriage license–granting officials in the United States. These officials vary in the constituencies they serve, as well as how they are selected, allowing us to evaluate long-standing hypotheses about bureaucratic responsiveness. Overall, we find no evidence of systematic discrimination against same-sex couples—regardless of responsiveness measure, institutions, ideology, or prior state legal history. We find, however, that among same-sex couples, officials tended to be more responsive to lesbian couples. In contrast to evidence in other areas of service provision, such as policing and federal assistance programs, we find bureaucrats tasked with provision of marriage services show little evidence of discrimination.},

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore the mechanisms underlying hiring discrimination against transgender women. Design/methodology/approach – The authors conduct a scenario experiment in which fictitious hiring decisions are made about transgender or cisgender female job candidates. In addition, these candidates are scored on statements related to theoretical reasons for hiring discrimination given in the literature. The resulting data are analysed by means of a multiple mediation model. Findings – The results suggest that prejudices with respect to the health of transgender individuals mediate unfavourable treatment of them. However, this mechanism is compensated by a beneficial perception concerning transgender women's autonomy and assertiveness. Social implications – Targeted policy measures are needed given the substantial labour market discrimination against transgender individuals measured in former studies. However, to combat this discrimination effectively, one needs to understand its underlying mechanisms. This study provides a first exploration of these mechanisms. Originality/value – This study innovates in being the first to explore the relative empirical importance of dominant (theoretical) explanations for hiring discrimination against transgender women. Thereby, the authors take the logical next step in the literature on labour market discrimination against transgender individuals.

Public health's commitment to social justice makes it a natural fit with intersectionality's focus on multiple historically oppressed populations. Yet despite a plethora of research focused on these populations, public health studies that reflect intersectionality in their theoretical frameworks, designs, analyses, or interpretations are rare. Accordingly, I describe the history and central tenets of intersectionality, address some theoretical and methodological challenges, and highlight the benefits of intersectionality for public health theory, research, and policy.},

We conducted an audit study on the general public- sending correspondence to 250,000 citizens randomly drawn from public voter registration lists. Our within-subjects experimental design tested the public's responsiveness to electronically delivered requests to volunteer their time to help with completing a simple task-taking a survey.We randomized whether the request came from either an ostensibly Black or an ostensibly White sender. We provide evidence that in electronic interactions, on average, the public is less likely to respond to emails from people they believe to be Black (rather than White). Our results give us a snapshot of a subtle form of racial bias that is systemic in the United States. What we term everyday or "paper cut" discrimination is exhibited by all racial/ethnic subgroups-outside of Black people themselves-and is present in all geographic regions in the United States.We benchmark paper cut discrimination among the public to estimates of discrimination among various groups of social elites.We show that discrimination among the public occurs more frequently than discrimination observed among elected officials and discrimination in higher education and themedical sector but simultaneously, less frequently than discrimination in housing and employment contexts. Our results provide a window into the discrimination that Black people in the United States face in dayto- day interactions with their fellow citizens.},

Empirical innovations include treatment of selection bias, estimation of Hicksian rather than Mar- shallian welfare measures, and analysis of the effects of controls on related uncontrolled markets. Other empirical studies examine effects of controls on mobility; few studies address potentially important supply effects directly.

abstract = {We report on racially disparate uses of Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Currently, approximately 1,500,000 bankruptcy petitions are filed each year, with about 30 percent of those petitions being Chapter 13 cases. Although Chapter 13 can offer some legal advantages for persons seeking to protect valuable assets such as a house or automobile, it generally offers less relief and costs more than the primary alternative available to consumers, Chapter 7. The chief feature of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case is a plan under which the debtor must devote all his or her disposable income to creditor repayment over a three- to five-year period. Chapter 7, in contrast, requires only that the debtor turn over all nonexempt assets, with over 90 percent of Chapter 7 debtors having no assets to turn over. This article reports on two studies, one using data from actual bankruptcy cases and the other involving an experiment with a national random sample of bankruptcy attorneys. Because the court system does not collect racial data on bankruptcy filers, the first study uses data from the Consumer Bankruptcy Project. Even after controlling for financial, demographic, and legal factors that might favor a Chapter 13 filing, African Americans are much more likely to file Chapter 13, as compared to debtors of other races. The second study reports on an experimental vignette sent to a random sample of consumer bankruptcy attorneys who represented debtors. The attorneys were more likely to recommend Chapter 13 when the hypothetical debtors were a couple named "Reggie {\&} Latisha," who attended an African Methodist Episcopal Church, as compared to a couple named "Todd {\&} Allison," who attended a United Methodist Church. Also, attorneys viewed "Reggie {\&} Latisha" as having better values and being more competent when they expressed a preference for Chapter 13 as compared to "Todd {\&} Allison," who were seen as having better values and being more competent when they wanted to file Chapter 7, giving them a "fresh start." Previous research and the results from the present experimental vignette study suggest that consumer bankruptcy attorneys may be playing a very important, although likely unintentional, role in creating the racial disparity in chapter choice. Together, the two studies raise questions about the fairness of the bankruptcy system. {\textcopyright} 2012 Cornell Law School and Wiley Subscription Services, Inc.},

(2010). Unlike standard pretest estimators which are based on some preliminary diagnostic test, these model averaging estimators provide a coherent way of making inference on the regression parameters of interest by taking into account the uncertainty due to both the estimation and the model selection steps. Special emphasis is given to a number practical issues that users are likely to face in applied work: equivariance to certain transformations of the explanatory variables, stability, accuracy, computing speed and out-of-memory problems. Performances of our bma and wals commands are illustrated using simulated data and empirical applications from the literature on model averaging estimation.},

abstract = {Many older US households have done little or no planning for retirement, and there is a substantial population that seems to undersave for retirement. Of particular concern is the relative position of older women, who are more vulnerable to old-age poverty due to their longer longevity. This paper uses data from a special module we devised on planning and financial literacy in the 2004 Health and Retirement Study. It shows that women display much lower levels of financial literacy than the older population as a whole. In addition, women who are less financially literate are also less likely to plan for retirement and be successful planners. These findings have important implications for policy and for programs aimed at fostering financial security at older ages.},

We argue that prior research that has not accounted for these dynamic selection processes has overstated the causal effect of homeownership on wealth. Using NLSY79 data and marginal structural models, we find that each ad-ditional year of homeownership increases midlife wealth in 2008 by about {\$}6,800, more than 25 percent less than estimates from models that do not account for dynamic selection. Hispanic and African American wealth benefits from each homeownership year are 62 percent and 48 percent as large as those of whites, respectively. Homeownership remains wealth-enhancing in 2012, but shows smaller returns. Our results confirm homeownership's role in wealth accumulation and that variation in both homeownership rates and the wealth benefits of homeownership contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in midlife wealth holdings.},

The considerable heterogeneity in the values arises largely from differences in attitudes towards risk and price sensitivity. Using interval regressions, we find that valuations are greater for those who perceive a high personal risk, consume a large quantity of tap water, or are environmentalists. The paper explores several methodological issues pertaining to the iterative choice format involving a choice between two policies char- acterized by their cost and GI risk. The analysis adjusts for starting point effects by basing valuations on the tradeoffs that are estimated to prevail at the “equitable tradeoff rate,”which is the starting cost-water quality tradeoff rate that produces a 50–50 split in the initial policy choice between policies with greater tradeoff rates and policies with lower tradeoff rates. The heterogeneity in valuations is also explored by examining quantile regression results and the determinants of the unbounded valuation amounts at the low and high extremes.},

The result was a large and lasting discontinuity in Head Start funding rates at the OEO cutoff for grant-writing assistance, but no discontinuity in other forms of federal social spending. We find evidence of a large negative discontinuity at the OEO cutoff in mortality rates for children ages 5-9 from causes that could be affected by Head Start, but not for other mortality causes or birth cohorts that should not be affected by the program. We also find suggestive evidence for a positive effect of Head Start on educational attainment in both the 1990 Census, concentrated among those cohorts born late enough to have been exposed to the program, and among respondents in the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988.},

abstract = {Abstract: We assess the role of race in loans made through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The PPP program, created by the U.S. government as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic, provides loans to small businesses so they can keep employees on their payroll. We argue that the historical record and PPP program design choices made it likely that many Black-owned businesses received smaller PPP loans than White-owned businesses. Using newly released data on the PPP program, we find that Black-owned businesses received loans that were approximately 50{\%} lower than observationally similar White-owned businesses. The effect is marginally smaller in areas with more bank competition and disappeared over time as changes to the PPP program were implemented allowing for entry by fintechs and other non-traditional lenders. Plain English Summary: We find that Black-owned businesses received loans through the Paycheck Protection Program that were approximately 50 percent lower than White-owned businesses with similar characteristics. However, this difference in loan size shrank over time as more non-bank lenders such as fintechs were allowed to participate in the program and began approving PPP loans. Loan size differences were also slightly smaller in zip codes containing a larger number of bank branches. These results are consistent with prior research which shows lending discrimination by commercial banks against Black borrowers. It is also consistent with studies showing that greater access to and competition among banks and other lenders can reduce discrimination. In light of these results we recommend that policy makers account for existing racial inequalities within banking or other systems in their program design to produce more equitable outcomes.},

One treatment group was offered peer advising and organized study group services. Another was offered substantial merit-scholarships for solid, but not necessarily top, first year grades. A third treatment group combined both interventions. Service take-up rates were much higher for students offered both services and scholarships than for those offered services alone. Females also used services more than males. No program had an effect on grades for males. However, first-term grades were significantly higher for females in the two scholarship treatment groups. These effects faded somewhat by year's end, but remain significant for females who planned to take enough courses to qualify for a scholarship. There also appears to have been an effect on retention for females offered both scholarships and services. This effect is large enough to generate an overall increase in retention. On balance, the results suggest that a combination of services and incentives is more promising than either alone.},

abstract = {In this article, Professor Kenji Yoshino seeks to explain why the category of bisexuality has been erased in contemporary American political and legal discourse. He first argues that the invisibility of bisexuality relative to homosexuality does not reflect the incidences of those orientations in the population. Defining bisexuality as the possession of more than incidental desire for both sexes, Yoshino shows that the major sexuality studies demonstrate that the incidence of bisexuality is in fact greater than or comparable to the incidence of homosexuality. Yoshino explains the erasure of bisexuality by positing that both self-identified heterosexuals and self-identified homosexuals have overlapping interests in the erasure of bisexuality that lead them into an "epistemic contract" of bisexual erasure. These interests include: (1) the stabilization of exclusive sexual orientation categories; (2) the retention of sex as an important diacritical axis; and (3) the protection of norms of monogamy. Noting that such contracts tend to become visible only when they are challenged, Yoshino describes how bisexuals have increasingly contested their own erasure. Finally, Yoshino examines the effects of bisexual invisibility and visibility in the legal realm, focusing on the sexual harassment jurisprudence of recent decades.},

Method: A total of 351 transgender individuals (n ϭ 226 transgender women and n ϭ 125 transgender men) participated in this study. Participants completed measures on transgender identity, family history of mental health concerns, perceptions of loss, coping, depression, and anxiety. Results: The rates of depressive symptoms (51.4{\%} for transgender women; 48.3{\%} for transgender men) and anxiety (40.4{\%} for transgender women; 47.5{\%} for transgender men) within the current study far surpass the rates of those for the general population. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the data—2 separate models were hypothesized, based on reports of anxiety or depression. The SEM results suggest that the processes for transgender women and transgender men are primarily similar for depression and anxiety; avoidant coping served as a mediator between transition status and both distress variables. Social support was directly related to distress variables, as well as indirectly related through avoidant coping. Conclusion: Results suggest the need for practitioners to focus on interventions that reduce avoidant coping strategies, while simultane-ously increasing social support, in order to improve mental health for transgender individuals. Individuals who are in the beginning stages of their transition will use different coping strategies than those who are in later stages; interventions should be adjusted on the basis of the transition status of transgender clients.},

However, since in the majority of studies race was the only variable that was manipulated, it is difficult to disentangle whether it is the ethnic background, the phenotype, the religious affiliation, or a combination of all that drives hiring discrimination. To answer this question, I draw on the theoretical framework of intersectionality and look at the role of ethnicity, as well as religion and non-white phenotype, and how they mediate discrimination outcomes using data from a correspondence study that was conducted across 49 states in the U.S. (N=2,107). The results show that next to racial preferences, employers also have ethnic preferences that influence their hiring decisions. In addition, I find significant evidence for an anti-Muslim bias which is stronger for phenotypical whites than for phenotypical non-whites. Although the overall penalty for applicants who are ascribed non-whites and who additionally have a Muslim affiliation is higher in magnitude, the penalty is not statistically different from the penalty of either being non-white or having a Muslim religious affiliation only. This result is not in line with intersectional theory and suggests that for some employers, one signal of otherness (either non-whiteness or Muslim religious affiliation) is enough to elicit strong bias.},

abstract = {Antidiscrimination law offers protection to workers who have been treated unfairly on the basis of their race, gender, religion, or national origin. In order for these protections to be invoked, however, potential plaintiffs must be aware of and able to document discriminatory treatment. Given the subtlety of contemporary forms of discrimination, it is often difficult to identify discrimination when it has taken place. The methodology of field experiments offers one approach to measuring and detecting hiring discrimination, providing direct observation of discrimination in real-world settings. In this article, we discuss the findings of two recent field experiments measuring racial discrimination in low wage labor markets. This research provides several relevant findings for researchers and those interested in civil rights enforcement: (1) it produces estimates of the rate of discrimination at the point of hire; (2) it yields evidence about the interactions associated with discrimination (many of which reveal the subtlety with which contemporary discrimination is practiced); and (3) it provides a vehicle for both research on and enforcement of antidiscrimination law.},

abstract = {Between 1889 and 1931 nearly 3,000 blacks were lynched in the American South. One of the few “theory driven” efforts to explain the lynching phenomenon has employed Blalock's “power threat hypothesis” as a framework, arguing that southern whites lynched blacks to retain political hegemony. This paper reexamines the empirical support for a power threat interpretation of southern lynchings and finds it wanting. It is shown that previous analyses have been plagued by a variety of conceptual and methodological weaknesses including: sensitivity to extremely influential cases; sample selection truncation; an inappropriate measure of lynching; and possible model misspecification. Our alternative analyses, including corrections for these problems, reveal no support for the power threat explanation for lynching. {\textcopyright} 1989 The University of North Carolina Press.},

abstract = {Introduction: The purpose of this study was to investigate emergency nurses' knowledge and attitudes about pain. Methods: A descriptive design was used for this study. A validated tool, the Knowledge and Attitudes Survey Regarding Pain (KASRP), was administered to nurses working in 5 U.S. emergency departments. Demographic data also were collected from each participant. Results: Ninety-one emergency nurses completed the survey. The mean total KASRP score was 76{\%}. No significant differences were found in mean total scores by age, education level, years of nursing experience, or years of ED experience. Eight questions were answered incorrectly by more than 50{\%} of participants. Five of these questions were related to opioid pharmacology and dosage, 2 concerned understanding of addiction and dependence, and one was linked to nurse assessment and patient report of pain level. Analysis of these 8 questions revealed that higher education levels had a weak positive association with correct answers. Discussion: Participants taking the survey scored comparably or better than participants in other reported studies using the KASRP. Years of nursing experience was not correlated with correct responses. Findings from this study underscore the Institute of Medicine's Pain in America recommendation to increase pain management education for all providers. {\textcopyright} 2014 Emergency Nurses Association.},

But what about in experimental contexts where treatment is randomised? Despite their ubiquity in analyses with group-constant variables, the rationale for using clustered standard errors in experimental contexts remains underdeveloped. In this paper I present an intuitive and applied explanation of when clustering is appropriate, building on recent contributions in the statistics and econometrics literatures. I demonstrate why randomisation does not lead to identical variance estimates across estimation strategies, and conduct a review of experimental studies published between 2017 and 2019 to show that these differences can be considerable. Finally, I provide practical guidance for when and why to cluster standard errors for common experimental designs.},

Population assumptions are stated separately from sampling assumptions, leading to simple statements as well as to important insights. The unified approach to linear and nonlinear models and to cross section and panel data enables straightforward coverage of more advanced methods. The numerous end-of-chapter problems are an important component of the book. Some problems contain important points not fully described in the text, and others cover new ideas that can be analyzed using tools presented in the current and previous chapters.

This article is a critical review of a self-help webcomic and other texts in the light of contract theory. Polyamorous people often use contractual concepts to understand their relationships and how to carry them out. Applying critical contract theory, we can trace how problems typical of contractual framing in other fields play out in the poly context. At the same time, these problems are recognized and responded to by poly people, and they dynamically reinterpret core contract concepts. This article thus makes two contributions. First, it provides a study in the way legal concepts percolate out into, and are transformed by, everyday life. Second, in consolidating some ways poly people have solved old contract problems, it offers conceptual tools for the continuing project of imagining more just ways of relating.},

Discriminatory behavior was quantified by the extent to which the hiring managers invited normal-weight versus obese applicants to a job interview. Several months after the behavioral data were obtained, the hiring managers completed an obesity IAT and explicit hiring preference measures. Only the IAT scores reliably predicted interview decisions. More specifically, hiring managers holding more negative automatic stereotypes about the obese were less likely to invite an obese applicant for an interview.

Furthermore, participants' perceptions of the age of a name poorly match with the true average birth year of people with that name, suggesting that researchers cannot simply use birth records as a proxy for perceived age.

The findings suggest landlords have preferences about tenants and make decisions based on signals communicated in inquiry emails from potential applicants. Blacks, Arab males, Muslims, and single parents are treated unfavorably while gay couples are preferred. These discrimination patterns are generally consistent with the theory of agent-based statistical discrimination.

Irrespective of ownership status, public services ought to be accessible regardless of clients' race, gender, ethnicity, or age. However, as theories of statistical discrimination and cream skimming suggest, market-based incentives may lead service providers to focus on nonminority clients because they perceive them as easier-to-serve and therefore less costly.This may lead to discrimination and hence jeopardizes equal access. In this study, we ask whether private, for-profit providers are more likely to discriminate on ethnic grounds compared to publicly owned providers. We implement a field experiment within the Flemish elderly care market by sending out email requests with either a Flemish or a Maghrebian name to all public and privately owned nursing homes. For overall response rates, no statistically significant differences between senders were found. However, we do find that privately owned facilities are about 20 percentage points less likely to provide information on how to enroll when the request is send from a Maghrebian name alias, and blinded coders perceive the information sent to the Maghrebian alias as less comprehensive. In publicly owned facilities, no such differences exist. We conclude that a public-private difference does exist, but that the mechanism of discrimination is subtler than expected. Rather than directly refusing to respond, nursing homes increase administrative burdens and learning costs for minority applicants.},

abstract = {A new map of Hollywood: the production and distribution of American motion pictures, Reg. Studies 36, 957–975. In this paper, I offer a reinterpretation of the economic geography of the so-called new Hollywood. The argument proceeds in six main stages. First, I briefly examine the debate on industrial organization in Hollywood that has gone on in the literature since the mid-1980s, and I conclude that the debate has become unnecessarily polarized. Second, I attempt to show how an approach that invokes both flexible specialization and systems-house forms of production is necessary to any reasonably complete analysis of the organization of production in the new Hollywood. Third, and on this basis, I argue that the Hollywood production system is deeply bifurcated into two segments comprising: (1) the majors and their cohorts of allied firms on the one hand; and (2) the mass of independent production companies on the other. Fourth, I reaffirm the continuing tremendous agglomerative attraction of Hollywood as a locale for motion-picture production, but I also describe in analytical and empirical terms how selected kinds of activities seek out satellite production locations in other parts of the world. Fifth, I show how the majors continue to extend their global reach by means of their ever more aggressive marketing and distribution divisions, and I discuss how this state of affairs depends on and amplifies the competitive advantages of Hollywood. Sixth and finally, I reflect upon some of the challenges that Hollywood must face up to as new cultural-products agglomerations arise all over the globe, offering potential challenges to its hegemony.},

We begin with definitions and measures of gender identity and provide clinical examples. Next, we summarize our search for studies to conduct two meta-analyses on: (a) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of psychotherapy conducted with transgender clients, and (b) RCTs of the outcomes of psychotherapies that attend explicitly to gender as a system of power compared with another bona-fide psychotherapy. Our search did not yield studies that fit either search criteria; thus, meta-analyses were not conducted. Instead, we conducted a content analysis of the 10 qualitative and quantitative studies on psychotherapy with transgender individuals. We conclude by highlighting the limitations of the research base, describing diversity considerations, and recommending therapeutic practices that attend to gender, gendered systems of power, oppression, and privilege.

We demonstrate an audit method for assessing discrimination in Toronto's online rental market. As a multicultural city with less segregation and more diverse visible minorities than most US cities, Toronto lends itself to multiname audit studies. We sent 5,620 fictitious email inquiries to landlords offering apartments on Craigslist, a popular Internet classifieds service. Each landlord received one inquiry each from five racialized groups-Caucasian, Black, E/SE Asian, Muslim/Arabic, and Jewish. In our experiments, "opportunity denying" discrimination (exclusion through nonresponse) was 10 times as common as "opportunity diminishing" discrimination (e.g., additional rental conditions). We estimate Muslim/Arabic-racialized men face the greatest resistance, with discrimination occurring in 12 percent of experiments. The level of discrimination is modest but significant for Asian men (7 percent), Blacks (5 percent), and Muslim/Arabic women (5 percent). Discrimination was evenly spread throughout the city. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Sociological Association.},

Proposition 212 places a cap on the effective property tax rate at 2.5{\%} and limits nominal annual growth in property tax revenues to 2.5{\%}, unless residents pass a referendum allowing a greater increase. The study analyzes the 1990-1994 period, a time when Massachusetts municipalities faced significant fiscal stress because of a 30{\%} cut in real state aid and a demographically driven increase in school enrollments. The findings include the following: (1) Proposition 212 significantly constrained local spending in some communities, with most of its impact on school spending; (2) constrained communities realized gains in property values to the degree that they were able to increase school spending despite the limitation; and (3) changes in non-school spending had little impact on property values. ??

Generally, the hypotheses concerning job sex-type and job-relevant information were supported. Female and male applicants received lower ratings when being considered for an opposite-sex-type job, and the difference between ratings of males and females decreased as more job-relevant information was provided. However, ratings of males and females did not differ as hypothesized in regard to salience of sex and rater sex. The research and practice implications of these results are discussed.},

@article{Nunez-Smith2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although experts recommend that healthcare organizations create forums for honest dialogue about race, there is little insight into the physician perspectives that may influence these conversations across the healthcare workforce. OBJECTIVE: To identify the range of perspectives that might contribute to workplace silence on race and affect participation in race-related conversations within healthcare settings. DESIGN: In-person, in-depth, racially concordant qualitative interviews. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five physicians of African descent practicing in the 6 New England states. APPROACH: Line-by-line independent coding and group negotiated consensus to develop codes structure using constant comparative method. MAIN RESULTS: Five themes characterize perspectives of participating physicians of African descent that potentially influence race-related conversations at work: 1) Perceived race-related healthcare experiences shape how participating physicians view healthcare organizations and their professional identities prior to any formal medical training; 2) Protecting racial/ethnic minority patients from healthcare discrimination is a top priority for participating physicians; 3) Participating physicians often rely on external support systems for race-related issues, rather than support systems inside the organization; 4) Participating physicians perceive differences between their interpretations of potentially offensive race-related work experiences and their non-minority colleagues' interpretations of the same experiences; and 5) Participating physicians are uncomfortable voicing race-related concerns at work. CONCLUSIONS: Creating a healthcare work environment that successfully supports diversity is as important as recruiting diversity across the workforce. Developing constructive ways to discuss race and race relations among colleagues in the workplace is a key step towards creating a supportive environment for employees and patients from all backgrounds.},

abstract = {In the last 15 years, much debate has ensued at the international level regarding gender mainstreaming (GM), its efficacy and future utility. In Canada, similar discussions have taken place where GM has largely been operationalized in the form of gender-based analysis (GBA). However, there has been a lack of clarity regarding the ways in which GBA as a conceptual framework compares to other approaches available for working towards equality in public policy, namely gender and diversity analysis (GDA) and intersectionality-based analysis (IBA).  As a result, the potential of these models to respond to diversity and inequality, especially GBA and GDA, are often overstated and/or conflated. The purpose of this paper is to elucidate the similarities and differences between GBA, GDA, and IBA.  This analysis illuminates the strengths and limitations of these types of approaches, especially in terms of how each conceptualizes and is able to address a wide variety of diversities among the Canadian population. This paper argues that only IBA is flexible enough to capture the multidimensional nature of oppression and discrimination because it disrupts the systematic prioritization of gender as a starting place for assessing experiences of inequality.},

This literature has ignored the impacts that these shocks have on older individuals, though there are reasons to believe that the effects are not uniform by age. Using data from the Census and the Health and Retirement Study, we measure the effects of local labor demand conditions on a host of outcomes for older individuals including employment, retirement, Social Security claiming, wages, and job characteristics. We find that local labor demand conditions do affect the labor and retirement behavior of the older segment of the population, including Social Security claiming decisions. We also find evidence that older individuals are especially responsive to local labor demand shifts in the service industry, which we show has observably different job characteristics that may be especially attractive to older workers. Similarly, we find evidence that labor demand shocks not only increase the wages of older workers but also make the jobs more attractive on non-pecuniary dimensions.},

Exploiting the timing of each offender's release from prison, I find that being released to a county with higher low-skilled wages significantly decreases the risk of recidivism. The impact of higher wages on recidivism is larger for both black offenders and first-time offenders, and in sectors that report being more willing to hire ex-offenders. These results are robust to individual- and county-level controls, such as policing and corrections activity, and do not appear to be driven by changes in the composition of released offenders during good or bad economic times.},

@article{Bound1995a,
abstract = {Abstract We draw attention to two problems associated with the use of instrumental variables (IV), the importance of which for empirical work has not been fully appreciated. First, the use of instruments that explain little of the variation in the endogenous explanatory variables can lead to large inconsistencies in the IV estimates even if only a weak relationship exists between the instruments and the error in the structural equation. Second, in finite samples, IV estimates are biased in the same direction as ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates. The magnitude of the bias of IV estimates approaches that of OLS estimates as the R 2 between the instruments and the endogenous explanatory variable approaches 0. To illustrate these problems, we reexamine the results of a recent paper by Angrist and Krueger, who used large samples from the U.S. Census to estimate wage equations in which quarter of birth is used as an instrument for educational attainment. We find evidence that, despite huge sample sizes, their IV estimates may suffer from finite-sample bias and may be inconsistent as well. These findings suggest that valid instruments may be more difficult to find than previously imagined. They also indicate that the use of large data sets does not necessarily insulate researchers from quantitatively important finite-sample biases. We suggest that the partial R 2 and the F statistic of the identifying instruments in the first-stage estimation are useful indicators of the quality of the IV estimates and should be routinely reported.},

@article{Shan2010,
abstract = {The 2000-2005 housing market boom in the U.S. has caused sharp increases in residential property taxes. Housing-rich but income-poor elderly homeowners often complain about rising tax burdens, and anecdotal evidence suggests that some move to reduce their tax burden. There has been little systematic analysis, however, of the link between property tax levels and the mobility rate of elderly homeowners. This paper investigates this link using household-level panel data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and a newly collected data set on state-provided property tax relief programs. These relief programs generate variation in effective property tax burdens that is not due solely to arguably endogenous local community choices about taxes and expenditure programs. The findings provide evidence suggesting that higher property taxes raise mobility among elderly homeowners. The point estimates from instrumental variable estimation using relief programs to generate instruments suggest that a {\$}100 increase in annual property taxes is associated with a 0.73 percentage point increase in the 2-year mobility rate for homeowners over the age of 50. This is an 8 percent increase from the baseline 2-year mobility rate of 9 percent. These results are robust to alternative specifications.},

@book{Neumark2019c,
abstract = {This volume brings together top scholars in industrial and organizational psychology with social psychologists to explore the research and theory relating to various areas of workplace discrimination. Many of the contributors to this book participated in a conference on workplace discrimination held at Rice University in May 2000. The idea came from the realization that there had been no attempt to bring together the various literatures on the topic. Discrimination and issues of employment diversity are significant topics today in IO psychology, business, and human resource management. This edited volume examines the following components of this important discussion: • how to explain discrimination in organizations; • understanding discrimination against specific groups; and • implications for practical efforts to reduce discrimination. This book brings together, in one volume, a review of the research on discrimination based on race, age, sexual orientation, gender, physical appearance, disability, and personality. In addition, it explores the multilevel antecedents and potential bases for a general model of discrimination in the workplace. While social psychological research and theory have provided invaluable insights, an understanding of discrimination in the workplace and solutions will require incorporating factors at the organizational level in addition to factors at the individual and group levels. Although a definitive model is not reached, the aim of this text is to facilitate future research and theory.},

abstract = {We extend the inference procedure for the synthetic control method in two ways. First, we propose parametric weights for the p-value that includes the equal weights benchmark of Abadie et al. [1]. By changing the value of this parameter, we can analyze the sensitivity of the test's result to deviations from the equal weights benchmark. Second, we modify the RMSPE statistic to test any sharp null hypothesis, including, as a specifc case, the null hypothesis of no effect whatsoever analyzed by Abadie et al. [1]. Based on this last extension, we invert the test statistic to estimate confdence sets that quickly show the point-estimates' precision, and the test's signifcance and robustness. We also extend these two tools to other test statistics and to problems with multiple outcome variables or multiple treated units. Furthermore, in a Monte Carlo experiment, we fnd that the RMSPE statistic has good properties with respect to size, power and robustness. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of our proposed tools by reanalyzing the economic impact of ETA's terrorism in the Basque Country, studied frst by Abadie and Gardeazabal [2] and Abadie et al.

In this article, we develop a nonparametric causal forest for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects that extends Breiman's widely used random forest algorithm. In the potential outcomes framework with unconfoundedness, we show that causal forests are pointwise consistent for the true treatment effect and have an asymptotically Gaussian and centered sampling distribution. We also discuss a practical method for constructing asymptotic confidence intervals for the true treatment effect that are centered at the causal forest estimates. Our theoretical results rely on a generic Gaussian theory for a large family of random forest algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first set of results that allows any type of random forest, including classification and regression forests, to be used for provably valid statistical inference. In experiments, we find causal forests to be substantially more powerful than classical methods based on nearest-neighbor matching, especially in the presence of irrelevant covariates.},

abstract = {In this essay, I begin by identifying the reasons that automation has not wiped out a majority of jobs over the decades and centuries. Automation does indeed substitute for labor—as it is typically intended to do. However, automation also complements labor, raises output in ways that leads to higher demand for labor, and interacts with adjustments in labor supply. Journalists and even expert commentators tend to overstate the extent of machine substitution for human labor and ignore the strong complementarities between automation and labor that increase productivity, raise earnings, and augment demand for labor. Changes in technology do alter the types of jobs available and what those jobs pay. In the last few decades, one noticeable change has been a "polarization" of the labor market, in which wage gains went disproportionately to those at the top and at the bottom of the income and skill distribution, not to those in the middle; however, I also argue, this polarization and is unlikely to continue very far into future. The final section of this paper reflects on how recent and future advances in artificial intelligence and robotics should shape our thinking about the likely trajectory of occupational change and employment growth. I argue that the interplay between machine and human comparative advantage allows computers to substitute for workers in performing routine, codifiable tasks while amplifying the comparative advantage of workers in supplying problem-solving skills, adaptability, and creativity.},

@article{Piette2006,
abstract = {Objective: We examined whether diabetes patients report discrimination when seeking health care, whether problems with interpersonal processes of care (IPC) were associated with discrimination reports, and the linkage between discrimination and patients' health. Methods: 810 diabetes patients were surveyed. Surveys were linked to hemoglobin A1c (A1C) and total cholesterol test results. Results: 14{\%} of participants reported experiencing discrimination in health care during the prior year, including discrimination due to their race (8{\%}), education or income (9{\%}), age (7{\%}), and gender (10{\%} of women). Patients with poorer than average ratings of their IPC had 2-8 times greater risk of reporting health care discrimination. Patients reporting health care discrimination had A1C levels that were higher than other patients (P = 0.002), more symptoms (P {\textless} 0.01), and poorer physical functioning (P = 0.007). Conclusions: Diabetes patients' reports of health care discrimination are strongly linked to the quality of their interactions with providers as well as multiple health outcomes. Practice implications: Physicians exert control over the clinical encounter and should endeavor to reduce patients' perceptions of discrimination during outpatient visits. Such efforts may result in more satisfied patients as well as improved health outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In our study, faculty members received e-mails from fictional prospective doctoral students seeking to schedule a meeting either that day or in 1 week; students' names signaled their race (Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, Indian, or Chinese) and gender. When the requests were to meet in 1 week, Caucasian males were granted access to faculty members 26{\%} more often than were women and minorities; also, compared with women and minorities, Caucasian males received more and faster responses. However, these patterns were essentially eliminated when prospective students requested a meeting that same day.

I then propose two interlocking reforms that would modernize the core functions of the program. The first is to improve SSDI's process for determining whether an applicant has remaining capacity to work by replacing the outdated medical-vocational “grid” with a new system of individual work capacity measurement. Second, I propose the introduction of partial disability benefits, which would make use of the new system for measuring work capacity and allow beneficiaries to combine benefit receipt with work. Partial benefits could be paired with a generalized benefit offset to further encourage work by beneficiaries, and the Social Security Administration's complex array of work-related rules could be eliminated.},

High labor force participation rates and high unemployment rates were found for both trans men and women. However, women were more likely to be out of the labor force and less likely to be employed than men. The unemployment rate of trans women was greater than that of trans men with otherwise similar characteristics; these results are consistent with the existence of an additional labor market penalty for being female on top of a penalty for being transgender. While perceived gender incongruence (the ability of other people to identify transgender individuals as such) was more common among women, the relation of that variable with labor force status was stronger for men. There was no evidence that state-level employment non-discrimination laws were associated with improved labor force outcomes.},

Their “Great Migration” from the South to the North contributed to profound social, economic, demographic, and cultural changes in northern cities. After the Great Migration, blacks continued to move in search of opportunity as some returned to the South, while others moved to suburbs or better neighborhoods within the North. My review focuses on the Great Migration by discussing research that has examined its causes, the characteristics of the participants, the adaptation of migrants to northern society, and their impact on northern cities. I also briefly review research on return migration to the South and residential mobility by African Americans. Finally, I identify key issues and discuss possible data sources for future research.},

This article presents evidence from a nationwide field experiment in the United States, which shows that prospective applicants with criminal records are about 5 percentage points less likely to receive information from college admission offices. However, this bias does not extend to race: there is no difference in response rates to Black and White applicants. The authors further show that bias is all but absent in public bureaucracies, as discrimination against formerly incarcerated applicants is driven by private schools. Examining why bias is stronger for private colleges, the study demonstrates that the private-public difference persists even after accounting for college selectivity, socio-economic composition and school finances. Moving beyond the measurement of bias, an intervention designed to reduce discrimination is evaluated: whether an email from an advocate mitigates bias associated with a criminal record. No evidence is found that advocate endorsements decrease bureaucratic bias.},

However, both perceived discrimination and more traditional measures of stress are related to health and play an incremental role in accounting for differences between the races in health status.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Substantial mental health disparities between lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals compared with heterosexuals have been identified. The aim was to examine potential sexual orientation-based disparities in mental health treatment in a prospectively analysed population-based sample in Sweden and to explore potential moderators and mediators. METHOD 30 730 individuals from the Stockholm Public Health Cohort were followed up with questionnaires and registry-based health record data on psychiatric healthcare visits and prescription drug use between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2011. RESULTS In adjusted analyses, gay and lesbian individuals were more likely to receive treatment for anxiety disorders (adjusted ORs (AOR)=3.80; 95{\%} CI 2.54 to 5.69) and to use antidepressant medication (AOR=2.13; 95{\%} CI 1.62 to 2.79); and bisexuals were more likely to receive treatment for mood disorders (AOR=1.58; 95{\%} CI 1.00 to 2.48), anxiety disorders (AOR=3.23; 95{\%} CI 2.22 to 4.72) and substance use disorders (AOR=1.91; 95{\%} CI 1.12 to 3.25), and to use antidepressant medication (AOR=1.91; 95{\%} CI 1.12 to 3.25) when compared with heterosexuals. The largest mental health treatment disparities based on sexual orientation were found among bisexual women, gay men and younger lesbian women. More frequent experiences of victimisation/threat of violence and lack of social support could partially explain these disparities. CONCLUSIONS This study shows a substantially elevated risk of poor mental health among LGB individuals as compared with heterosexuals. Findings support several factors outlined in the minority stress theory in explaining the mechanisms behind these disparities.},

abstract = {Gender "mainstreaming" is an important concept in feminist politics because it integrates a gendered perspective into all policy- and decision-making. However, while most scholars agree that gender mainstreaming has the potential to transform social relations, to date it has been limited and delivered only marginal benefits for a few women. In the Canadian context, scholars have pointed to several contextual and conceptual issues that limit the transformative potential of gender-based analysis. While such studies have contributed to our understanding of the impacts of gender mainstreaming, the author suggests that we must also explore the creative or productive dimensions of mainstreaming. When we do so, we see that gender mainstreaming constructs a new form of worker: the "gender expert," who is then given authority to analyse, monitor and suggest interventions based on "expert analysis." From this perspective, gender analysis becomes a "technology of rule," constructing gender experts whose power ultimately goes unscrutinized in the context of the organization, thus obscuring the ways in which gender systems are reproduced or fractured by gender mainstreaming itself. In closing, the author calls for a reorientation of gender mainstreaming, away from an analytic approach that focuses only on the instrumental effects of policies and towards an approach that illuminates both the instrumental and creative impacts of policies. {\textcopyright} The Institute of Public Administration of Canada.},

@article{Healy2010,
abstract = {Does information irrelevant to government performance affect voting behavior? If so, how does this help us understand the mechanisms underlying voters' retrospective assessments of candidates' performance in office? To precisely test for the effects of irrelevant information, we explore the electoral impact of local college football games just before an election, irrelevant events that government has nothing to do with and for which no government response would be expected. We find that a win in the 10 d before Election Day causes the incumbent to receive an additional 1.61 percentage points of the vote in Senate, gubernatorial, and presidential elections, with the effect being larger for teams with stronger fan support. In addition to conducting placebo tests based on postelection games, we demonstrate these effects by using the betting market's estimate of a team's probability of winning the game before it occurs to isolate the surprise component of game outcomes. We corroborate these aggregate-level results with a survey that we conducted during the 2009 NCAA men's college basketball tournament, where we find that surprising wins and losses affect presidential approval. An experiment embedded within the survey also indicates that personal well-being may influence voting decisions on a subconscious level. We find that making people more aware of the reasons for their current state of mind reduces the effect that irrelevant events have on their opinions. These findings underscore the subtle power of irrelevant events in shaping important real-world decisions and suggest ways in which decision making can be improved.},

abstract = {Differences in voter turnout among industrial democracies are a function of political institutions and electoral law. Specifically, the presence of nationally competitive electoral districts provides incentives for parties and candidates to mobilize voters everywhere, thereby increasing turnout. Disproportionality in the translation of votes into legislative seats provides a disincentive to voting, which lowers turnout. Multipartyism assigns elections a less decisive role in government formation, depressing turnout. By generating more decisive governments, unicameralism provides a clearer link between elections and legislation, increasing turnout. Finally, mandatory voting laws produce a disincentive to not vote. Empirical analyses of average voter-turnout levels in the 1970s and 1960s across 19 democracies are consistent with these expectations, although Switzerland and the United States appear to be outliers. The results have major implications for the way we interpret national differences in voter-turnout rates.},

However, help-seekers in the second study, who signaled lower education than those in the first, were confronted with significantly lower accessibility overall. Moreover, black help-seekers with low education and high social need (i.e., a caseworker) received significantly fewer positive responses than any other group. Although the two studies are not directly comparable, their results suggest a hierarchy of accessibility: MHPs prefer more educated help-seekers over less educated ones and among those less educated prefer black help-seekers with a caseworker the least.

@article{Rosen2021,
abstract = {An extensive literature documents racial discrimination in housing, focusing on its prevalence and effect on non-White populations. This article studies how such discrimination operates, and the intermediaries who engage in it: landlords. A fundamental assumption of racial discrimination research is that gatekeepers such as landlords are confronted with a racially heterogeneous applicant pool. The reality of urban housing markets, however, is that historical patterns of residential segregation intersect with other structural barriers to drive selection into the applicant pool, such that landlords are more often selecting between same-race applicants. Using interviews and observations with 157 landlords in four cities, we ask: how do landlords construct their tenants' race within racially segmented housing markets, and how does this factor into their screening processes? We find that landlords distinguish between tenants based on the degree to which their behavior conforms to insidious cultural narratives at the intersection of race, gender, and class. Landlords with large portfolios rely on screening algorithms, whereas mom-and-pop landlords make decisions based on informal mechanisms such as “gut feelings,” home visits, and the presentation of children. Landlords may put aside certain racial prejudices when they have the right financial incentives, but only when the tenant also defies stereotypes. In this way, landlords' intersectional construction of race—even within a predominantly Black or Latino tenant pool—limits residential options for low-income, subsidized tenants of color, burdening their search process. These findings have implications for how we understand racial discrimination within racially homogenous social spheres. Examining landlords' screening practices offers insight into the role housing plays in how racism continues to shape life outcomes—both explicitly through overt racial bias, and increasingly more covertly, through algorithmic automation and digital technologies.},

abstract = {This article draws upon a major social science theoretical approach-systemic racism theory-to assess decades of empirical research on racial dimensions of U.S. health care and public health institutions. From the 1600s, the oppression of Americans of color has been systemic and rationalized using a white racial framing-with its constituent racist stereotypes, ideologies, images, narratives, and emotions. We review historical literature on racially exploitative medical and public health practices that helped generate and sustain this racial framing and related structural discrimination targeting Americans of color. We examine contemporary research on racial differentials in medical practices, white clinicians' racial framing, and views of patients and physicians of color to demonstrate the continuing reality of systemic racism throughout health care and public health institutions. We conclude from research that institutionalized white socioeconomic resources, discrimination, and racialized framing from centuries of slavery, segregation, and contemporary white oppression severely limit and restrict access of many Americans of color to adequate socioeconomic resources-and to adequate health care and health outcomes. Dealing justly with continuing racial "disparities" in health and health care requires a conceptual paradigm that realistically assesses U.S. society's white-racist roots and contemporary racist realities. We conclude briefly with examples of successful public policies that have brought structural changes in racial and class differentials in health care and public health in the U.S. and other countries. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Models of statistical discrimination based on differential observability of productivity across races can explain the pattern and magnitudes of wage differentials but do not address employment and unemployment. At their current state of development, models of statistical discrimination based on rational stereotypes have little empirical content. It is plausible that models combining elements of the search models with statistical discrimination could fit the data.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System. I test discrimination against blind tenants assisted by guide dogs in the Italian rental housing market by using fake application letters. I compare three fictitious household tenants: married couples, married couples where the wife is blind and owns a guide dog, and married couples where the normal-sighted wife owns a normal dog. I find that the households with a blind wife are invited less often to visit apartments they applied for, because of the presence of their guide dog; using the language of Italian and E.U. laws, this behavior is called indirect discrimination against disabled people. This result is robust.},

abstract = {The wild bootstrap was originally developed for regression models with heteroskedasticity of unknown form. Over the past 30 years, it has been extended to models estimated by instrumental variables and maximum likelihood and to ones where the error terms are (perhaps multiway) clustered. Like bootstrap methods in general, the wild bootstrap is especially useful when conventional inference methods are unreliable because large-sample assumptions do not hold. For example, there may be few clusters, few treated clusters, or weak instruments. The package boottest can perform a wide variety of wild bootstrap tests, often at remarkable speed. It can also invert these tests to construct confidence sets. As a postestimation command, boottest works after linear estimation commands, including regress, cnsreg, ivregress, ivreg2, areg, and reghdfe, as well as many estimation commands based on maximum likelihood. Although it is designed to perform the wild cluster bootstrap, boottest can also perform the ordinary (nonclustered) version. Wrappers offer classical Wald, score/Lagrange multiplier, and Anderson-Rubin tests, optionally with (multiway) clustering. We review the main ideas of the wild cluster bootstrap, offer tips for use, explain why it is particularly amenable to computational optimization, state the syntax of boottest, artest, scoretest, and waldtest, and present several empirical examples.},

Urban growth occurring purely in response to these fundamental forces cannot be faulted as socially undesirable, but three market failures may distort their operation, upsetting the allocation of land between agricultural and urban uses and justifying criticism of urban sprawl. These are the failure to account for the benefits of open space, excessive commuting because of a failure to account for the social costs of congestion, and failure to make new development pay for the infrastructure costs it generates. Precise remedies for these market failures are two types of development taxes and congestion tolls levied on commuters. Each of these remedies leads to a reduction in the spatial size of the city.},

Secondly, it explores the degree to which the local labour market is shaped by external forces operating at the national and international scale. Thirdly, it considers the extent to which the local labour market can be conceptualized as a multi-vocal social construct. These ideas are developed through a case study of union involvement in the Vancouver film industry. During the summer of 1997 there was a period of discord between the actors' union in Vancouver, UBCP, and American producers, represented by the AMPTP. These tensions were exacerbated by the involvement of the Provincial Government, the local press and other vested interest groups. Using a variety of interview and documentary evidence, this dispute is used to illustrate the geographically specific and highly complex nature of local labour markets.},

abstract = {The aims of this study were to examine how workers' negative age stereotypes (i.e., denying older workers' ability to develop) and negative meta-stereotypes (i.e., beliefs that the majority of colleagues feel negative about older workers) are related to their attitudes towards retirement (i.e., occupational future time perspective and intention to retire), and whether the strength of these relationships is influenced by workers' self-categorization as an "older" person. Results of a study among Dutch taxi drivers provided mixed support for the hypotheses. Negative meta-stereotypes, but not negative age stereotypes, were associated with fewer perceived opportunities until retirement and, in turn, a stronger intention to retire. Self-categorization moderated the relationships between negative age (meta-)stereotypes and occupational future time perspective. However, contrary to expectations, the relations were stronger among workers with a low self-categorization as an older person in comparison with workers with a high self-categorization in this regard. Overall, results highlight the importance of psychosocial processes in the study of retirement intentions and their antecedents.},

The defining feature of this design is that treatment as-signment is based on whether the value of a score exceeds a known cutoff. We review core conceptual issues, discussing differences and similarities between RD designs and randomized experiments, basic conditions for identification of RD effects, and parametric and nonparamet-ric alternatives to inference. We distinguish between a continuity-based RD approach, which relies on the continuity of relevant regression functions, and a randomization-based RD ap-proach, which relies on the random assignment of treatment near the cutoff. We discuss best practices for estimation and inference in both cases, and illustrate our recommendations with a political science application.

But, although higher-class men receive a corresponding overall boost in evaluations, higher-class women do not, because they face a competing, negative stereotype that portrays them as less committed to full-time, intensive careers. This commitment penalty faced by higher-class women offsets class-based advantages these applicants may receive in evaluations. Consequently, signals of higher-class origin provide an advantage for men but not for women in this elite labor market.},

By comparing the employment discrimination experiences of subpopulations of people with disabilities, the project has identified patterns of discrimination that are differentiated most strikingly by disability type. Chapters describe, compare, and contrast the employment discrimination experiences of people with HIV/AIDS, mental retardation, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, deafness and hearing impairments, speech impairments, traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, missing limbs, and disfigurement. Together, these investigations provide critical, population-level data that can be used to inform direct service, advocacy, employer education, and professional training efforts.},

Although runaway production is an old complaint in the entertainment media industries, the production location decisions of media entertainment firms since the mid-1990s look considerably different than those in the 1980s when a similar alarm was raised. Among the critical differences are: (1) the location of an expanded range of production activities in regions outside the "headquarters" location of Los Angeles; (2) the ability of transnational firms to access multiple, self-organized and networked pools of skilled labor in production locations outside Los Angeles; and (3) the expanded role of the sub-national state in reducing the overall production costs of transnational firms, including those attendant to their use of skilled labor pools. The current controversy provides an opportunity to consider how transnational firms use international out-sourcing to address their need for high-skilled and specialized labor in the production process. It also contributes to the on-going theoretical debate over how transnational firms are combining the advantages to be derived from territorial agglomeration with those of substitutability of labor skills in multiple locations. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The premise of current welfare policies is that recipients are avoiding work {\&} a work requirement will end welfare dependency; unemployment is equated with labor market inexperience {\&} economic inactivity. The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation (SD), a poor rural community with high unemployment, contradicts these assumptions. Many Lakota individuals have off-reservation wage work experience; there simply are not enough local jobs to absorb their human capital. Lakota households, however, are involved in a complex combination of socially embedded economic activities outside wage work. Imposing the premises of Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) on Pine Ridge results in indirect pressures toward urban migration {\&} cultural assimilation. Further, by imposing rigid notions of work, TANF runs the risk of destroying the economic flexibility that makes survival possible for poor households in Pine Ridge. Welfare {\&} development policies need to reflect the real economies of rural American Indian reservations rather than those of superficially assimilated {\&} economically imagined communities. 62 References.

This finding holds irrespective of how important these covariates are for accurately predicting post-treatment values of the outcome, potentially threatening the estima-tor's unbiasedness.

@article{Carlsson2017,
abstract = {In most countries, there are systematic age and gender differences in labor market outcomes. Older workers and women often have lower employment rates, and the duration of unemployment increases with age. These patterns may reflect age and gender differences in either labor demand (i.e. discrimination) or labor supply. In this study, we investigate the importance of demand effects by analyzing whether employers use information about a job applicant's age and gender in their hiring decisions. To do this, we conducted a field experiment, where over 6,000 fictitious resumes with randomly assigned information about age (in the interval 35-70) and gender were sent to employers with a vacancy and the employers' responses (callbacks) were recorded. We find that the callback rate starts to fall substantially early in the age interval we consider. This decline is steeper for women than for men. These results indicate that age discrimination is a widespread phenomenon affecting workers already in their early 40s in many occupations. Ageism and occupational skill loss due to aging are unlikely explanations of these effects. Instead, our employer survey suggests that employer stereotypes about three worker characteristics – ability to learn new tasks, flexibility/adaptability, and ambition – are important. We find no evidence of gender discrimination against women on average, but the gender effect is heterogeneous across occupations and firms. Women have a higher callback rate in female-dominated occupations and firms, and when the recruiter is a woman. These results suggest that an in-group bias affects hiring patterns, which may reinforce the existing gender segregation in the labor market.},

In the present work, we examine racial bias at the intersection of these domains: racial bias in pain-related perceptions among National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division 1 sport medical staff. Using experimental vignettes about a student-athlete who injured his/her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), we find, like prior work, that respondents perceived Black (vs. White) targets as having higher initial pain tolerance. Moreover, this bias was mediated by perceptions of social class. We extend prior work by showing racial bias was not evident on other outcome measures, including perception of recovery process pain, likelihood of over-reporting pain, and over-use of drugs to combat pain. This suggests stricter boundary conditions on bias in pain perceptions than had been previously recognized. {\textcopyright} 2018, {\textcopyright} 2018 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

@article{Loury1998,
abstract = {T he literature reviewed in the three main papers in this symposium focuses on discrimination against women and blacks in labor, credit, and con-sumer goods markets. Each paper makes the point that such discrimina-tion persists, and it is a point worth making. But when considering the topic of racial or gender discrimination, economists should be willing to look beyond what happens within markets. Of course, we economists have a professional tendency to focus on how markets work or fail. Economic theory suggests that discrimination based on gender or racial identity should be arbitraged away in markets of competitive sellers, employers and lenders. In fact, however, such discrimination is readily observed in society, and this anomaly attracts attention. Critics of the neoclassical orthodoxy in economics seize upon it, and defenders of that orthodoxy seek to explain it away. Thus, evi-dence that wage differences between the races or sexes have declined, after con-trolling for worker productivity, is supposed to vindicate the economist's belief in market forces. I think this way of approaching the problem is too narrow. With respect to wages, for example, the usual focus is on the demand side of the labor market-employers either have a so-called "taste for discrimination," or are thought to use race as a proxy for unobserved variables that imply lower productivity for blacks. The primary normative claim in this approach is that such discrimination is morally offensive, a legitimate object of regulatory intervention, and a significant contrib-utor to the scourge of race and sex inequality in society. But also implicit here is the notion that if inequality were due to supply side differences-in the skills pre- 118 Journal of Economic Perspectives sented to employers by blacks and whites, for example-then the resulting disparity would not raise the same moral issues, nor give a comparable warrant for interven-tion. With respect to housing markets, there is a comparable view-that residential segregation induced by the discriminatory behavior of realtors is a more severe problem than the segregation that comes about because of the freely chosen de-cisions of market participants.},

abstract = {Our research sits at the intersection of communication studies, sociology, cyberculture, and political philosophy and theory. In 2014, a 10+-min segment on polyamory aired on Portuguese open-access national television, during the prime-time newscast, and was viewed by several million people, according to official reports. The news piece was also advertised and shared online, especially via Facebook, by the network's official page. Moreover, the piece was aired within the context of a segment that celebrated the 40-year anniversary of the 1974 liberal revolution that overthrew the right-wing dictatorial regime that ruled Portugal for more than half of the twentieth century. This context served to frame polyamory (alongside other topics) as explicitly political by presenting them as freedoms seized by that liberal revolution. This study used a mixed-method approach to the analysis of online comments on Facebook made with respect to the referred news piece, by deploying both content analysis and critical discourse analysis to try to understand how the political nature of polyamory is negotiated (affirmed or disavowed), and what ideal of the “political” is mobilized in that negotiation, in connection with other elements of intimate citizenship and modes of systemic discrimination. Through this analysis, we will deepen our understanding of how lay people construe the “political” and the (non-)politicalness of polyamory. It also helps advance contemporary understandings of how polyamory is represented in mainstream media, understood by audiences, and how media—and debates on online social networks—can both amplify and help fight against harmful stereotypes of minorities. Through this research, we contribute to political theory by opening up new ways of conceptualizing the realm of the political as an open-ended definition that must encompass changes in modes of sociality, including a politics of relating as a sub-field, likewise to the study of social movements, and their strategies, around consensual non-monogamies. Overall, results show that the recognition of the validity of polyamory is not the same as the realization that relationship orientation is a political issue in itself and that a privatized mode of understanding politics seems prevalent as well as the default framework used in the comments we analyzed. In addition to that, and as other research has already noted, incivility and hate speech was prevalent in online comments and discussions, further dampening the political potential of dissident modes of existence, especially given that incivility is also deployed by those speaking in favor of Othered identities and experiences.},

Method: An annual telephone survey of people with a mental health diagnosis conducted to evaluate the Time to Change antistigma campaign in England. Of 985 people who participated in 2013, 84 took part in a qualitative interview which was audio recorded. Of these, 50 interviews were transcribed and thematically analysed to explore accounts of discrimination. We analysed common types of behaviour; motivations ascribed to the discriminators; expectations of what fair treatment would have been; and the impact of discrimination on participants. Results: Discrimination was most common in five contexts: welfare benefits, mental health care, physical health care, family and friends. Participants often found it hard to assess whether a behaviour was discriminatory or not. Lack of support, whether by public services or by friends and family, was often experienced as discrimination, reflecting an expectation that positive behaviours and reasonable adjustments should be offered in response to mental health needs. Conclusion: The impact of discrimination across different settings was often perceived by participants as aggravating their mental health, and there is thus a need to treat discrimination as a health issue, not just a social justice issue.},

Methods. Moving to Opportunity was a randomized, controlled trial in which families from public housing in high-poverty neighborhoods were moved into private housing in near-poor or nonpoor neighborhoods, with a subset remaining in public housing. At the 3-year follow-up of the New York site, 550 families were reinterviewed. Results. Parents who moved to low-poverty neighborhoods reported significantly less distress than parents who remained in high-poverty neighborhoods. Boys who moved to less poor neighborhoods reported significantly fewer anxious/depressive and de-pendency problems than did boys who stayed in public housing. Conclusions. This study provides experimental evidence of neighborhood income ef-fects on mental health. borhood is associated with unfavorable physi-cal and mental health. 3 Thus, moving from a high-poverty neighborhood to a less poor neighborhood may improve health. This study focused on the short-term im-pact of the MTO program in New York City. The consequences of moving from high-rise public housing in high-poverty neighbor-hoods to either private housing in similar neighborhoods or private housing in low-poverty neighborhoods for parents' and chil-dren's mental health were investigated. Out-comes were examined approximately 2 years after families who received vouchers had moved (3 years since baseline and random assignment).},

abstract = {In Canada, the institutional framework that shapes labour markets for film and television professionals includes a combination of policy instruments operating at local, provincial and federal levels. Through an examination of the impact that federal and provincial film and television tax credit programmes have on labour markets and workers in the English language Canadian independent film and television production industry, this analysis will demonstrate that despite having an overall, albeit fluctuating, positive impact on the volume of work at national and subnational levels, tax credit programmes at the provincial level are producing perverse labour market effects. Although designed to promote Canada and its provincial jurisdictions as globally competitive centres of excellence for film and television production, the application of the tax credit scheme has negatively impacted on both working conditions and labour mobility for highly skilled film and television production workers in the English language independent production sector. The end result is a policy regime deeply rooted in a competition framework that contributes to, rather than ameliorates, the vulnerability of workers in film and television production labour markets in both major and regional production centres.},

The basic corporate context within which television-program production and distribution are accomplished is described in detail. Special attention is paid here to issues of vertical integration and disintegration across the entire chain of activities in the television industry. The geography of television-program production in the United States is analyzed and the pre-eminence of Hollywood in this regard is underlined. The dynamics of locational agglomeration in Hollywood are scrutinized. A case study of a prime-time television show is presented in which it is demonstrated how production of the show depends upon an extraordinarily detailed system of procurements from suppliers in and around Hollywood. The accelerating process of decentralization of certain kinds of television production activities from Hollywood is then subject to analysis. The article concludes on a speculative note in which it is predicted that in the future, and especially in the television-program producing segment of the entertainment industry, Hollywood is likely to face intensifying competition in global markets.},

In the case of pure treatment models, where all observations within clusters are either treated or not, the latter procedure can work remarkably well. The key requirement is that all cluster sizes, regardless of treatment, should be similar. Unfortunately, the analogue of this requirement is not likely to hold for difference-in-differences regressions.

@article{Barefoot2017,
abstract = {Introduction: Previous research has consistently demonstrated that, in comparison to their cisgender heterosexual counterparts, lesbians face a multitude of women's healthcare-related disparities. However, very little research has been conducted that takes an intersectionality approach to examining the potential influences of rural-urban location on the health-related needs and experiences of lesbians. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively compare rural and urban lesbians' access to women's health care, experiences with women's healthcare providers (WHCPs), and preventive behavior using a large, diverse sample of lesbians from across the USA. Methods: A total of 895 (31.1{\%} rural and 68.9{\%} urban) lesbian-identified cisgender women (ie not transgender) from the USA participated in the current online study. As part of a larger parent study, participants were recruited from across the USA through email communication to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)-focused organizations and online advertisements. Participants were asked to complete a series of questions related to their women's healthcare-related experiences and behaviors (ie access to care, experiences with WHCPs, and preventive behavior). A series of $\chi$2 analyses were utilized in order to examine rural-urban differences across dependent variables. Results: An examination of sexual risks revealed that relatively more rural lesbians reported at least one previous male sexual partner in comparison to the urban sample of lesbians (78.1{\%} vs 69.1{\%}, $\chi$2(1, N=890)=7.56, p=0.006). A similarly low percentage of rural (42.4{\%}) and urban (42.9{\%}) lesbians reported that they have a WHCP that they see on a regular basis for preventive care. In terms of experiences with WHCP providers, relatively fewer rural lesbians indicated that their current WHCP had discussed/recommended the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in comparison to urban lesbians (27.5{\%} vs. 37.2{\%}; $\chi$2 (1,N=796)=7.24, p=0.007). No other rural-urban differences in experiences with WHCPs emerged - few rural and urban lesbians had been asked about their sexual orientation by their WHCP (38.8{\%} and 45.0{\%}, respectively), been provided with appropriate safe-sex education by their WHCP (21.4{\%} and 25.3{\%}), had their last HIV/sexually transmitted infection screening instigated by their WHCP (if applicable 15.7{\%} and 19.5{\%}), and reported that their WHCP seems knowledgeable about lesbian health concerns (56.5{\%} vs 54.6{\%}). In terms of preventive behavior, significantly fewer rural lesbians aged 40 years or more had received a mammogram in the past 3 years (63.2{\%} vs 83.2{\%}; $\chi$2(1, N=163)=8.36, p=0.004) when compared to their urban counterparts. No other significant rural-urban differences in preventive behaviors emerged. A similarly low percentage of rural and urban lesbians indicated that they have received the HPV vaccination (22.8{\%} and 29.0{\%}, respectively) and/or have had a HIV/STI screening (43.0{\%} and 47.8{\%}), Pap test (62.0{\%} and 64.5{\%}) or breast exam (59.2{\%} and 62.8{\%}), in the past 3 years. Conclusions: The current findings highlight that rural lesbians in the USA, in comparison to urban lesbians, may experience elevated health risks related to being more likely to have at least one previous male sexual partner, less likely to be recommended the HPV vaccination by a WHCP, and, for those 40 or older, less likely to receive routine mammogram screenings. Furthermore, rural lesbians appear to engage in similarly low rates of HPV vaccination and regular HIV/STI screenings, Pap tests, and clinical breast exams as their urban counterparts. Given the increased cervical and breast cancer risks associated with rural living, the current findings underscore the dire need for health promotion efforts aimed at increasing rural lesbians' engagement in routine pelvic and breast exams.},

abstract = {Despite efforts to recruit and retain more women, a stark gender disparity persists within academic science. Abundant research has demonstrated gender bias in many demographic groups, but has yet to experimentally investigate whether science faculty exhibit a bias against female students that could contribute to the gender disparity in academic science. In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student - who was randomly assigned either a male or female name - for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. The gender of the faculty participants did not affect responses, such that female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student. Mediation analyses indicated that the female student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent. We also assessed faculty participants' preexisting subtle bias against women using a standard instrument and found that preexisting subtle bias against women played a moderating role, such that subtle bias against women was associated with less support for the female student, but was unrelated to reactions to the male student. These results suggest that interventions addressing faculty gender bias might advance the goal of increasing the participation of women in science.},

These methods are used to decompose the difference in a distributional statistic between two groups, or its change over time, into various explanatory factors. While the original work of Oaxaca and Blinder considered the case of the mean, our main focus is on other distributional statistics besides the mean, such as quantiles, the Gini coefficient or the variance. We discuss the assumptions required for identifying the different elements of the decomposition, as well as various estimation methods proposed in the literature. We also illustrate how these methods work in practice by discussing existing applications and working through a set of empirical examples throughout the paper. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We assess the extent to which manufacturing decline and housing booms contributed to changes in U.S. non-employment during the 2000s. Using a local labor market design, we estimate that manufacturing decline significantly increased non-employment during 2000-2007, while local housing booms decreased non-employment by roughly the same magnitude. The effects of manufacturing decline persist through 2011, but we find no persistent non-employment effects of local housing booms, most plausibly because housing booms were associated with subsequent busts of similar magnitude. We also find that housing booms significantly reduce the likelihood that displaced manufacturing workers remain non-employed, suggesting that housing booms "mask" non-employment growth that would have otherwise occurred earlier in the absence of the booms. Applying our estimates to the national labor market, we find that housing booms reduced non-employment growth by roughly 30 percent during 2000-2007 and that roughly 40 percent of the aggregate increase in non-employment during 2000-2011 can be attributed to manufacturing decline. Collectively, our results suggest that much of the non-employment growth during the 2000s can be attributed to manufacturing decline and these effects would have appeared in aggregate statistics earlier had it not been for the large, temporary increases in housing demand.},

abstract = {This research was undertaken to determine whether or not disabled persons are at a disadvantage when seeking employment. An experimental design-mailing unsolicited job applications to employers-in a natural social setting allowed a study of employer's behaviour under naturalistic conditions. A randomized comparative study was conducted on a representative sample of 2228 branches of French companies, stratified as a function of their size. Four different profiles of applications were constituted by crossing two independent variables: the presence or absence of mention of a physical deficiency (paraplegia, with a wheelchair) in the job application, and high or low level of qualification. Using random sampling, the investigators sent each company an application for a job using one of these four profiles. Two experimental groups of companies were constituted (each of which received an application with either high or low qualification and mention of disability) with two control groups (applications with high/low qualification, without mention of disability). It was found that highly qualified able-bodied applicants were 1.78 times more likely to receive a favourable response than their disabled counterparts, and modestly qualified able-bodied applicants were 3.2 times more likely to receive a positive response. As well, discrimination became more marked as company size increased. In comparison with laboratory experiments, the results of this research permit a more objective assessment of discriminatory behaviour by companies confronted by disabled job applicants, and show a significant amount of discrimination towards individuals with a physical disability. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether Hispanic patients with isolated long-bone fractures are less likely to receive emergency department (ED) analgesics than similar non-Hispanic white patients. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: The UCLA Emergency Medicine Center, a level I trauma center. PARTICIPANTS: All Hispanic and non-Hispanic white ED patients aged 15 to 55 years, seen between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 1991, with isolated long-bone fractures, identified by ICD-9 codes 812, 813, 821, and 823, were eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria included injury more than 6 hours prior to presentation, "possible" or chip fractures only, altered mentation, or ethanol intoxication. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Emergency department administration of analgesic or no analgesic. RESULTS: The study group consisted of 139 patients meeting inclusion criteria, of whom 31 were Hispanic and 108 non-Hispanic white. Non-Hispanic whites were significantly more likely to speak English, be insured, and suffer nonoccupational injuries. Hispanics were twice as likely as non-Hispanic whites to receive no ED pain medication (crude relative risk (RR), 2.12; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.35 to 3.32; P=.003). The RR for ethnicity was similar and significant (P{\textless}.05) after controlling by stratification for covariates related to patient, injury, or physician characteristics. After controlling for several covariates simultaneously through multiple logistic regression, ethnicity remained the strongest predictor of ED analgesic administration (odds ratio (OR), 7.46; 95{\%} CI, 2.22 to 25.04; P{\textless}.01). CONCLUSIONS: Hispanics with isolated long-bone fractures are twice as likely as non-Hispanic whites to receive no pain medication in the UCLA Emergency Medicine Center. No covariate measured in this study could account for this effect. An ethnic basis for variability in analgesic practice needs to be further characterized. (JAMA. 1993;269:1537-1539).

METHODS We performed secondary analysis of a community intervention conducted in 2002 and 2003 for the New Hampshire Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health 2010 Initiative, surveying African descendants, Mexican Americans, and other Latinos. We assessed mental health status with the Mental Component Summary (MCS12) of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 12, and measured discrimination with questions related to respondents' ability to achieve goals, discomfort/anger at treatment by others, and access to quality health care. RESULTS Self-reported discrimination was associated with a lower MCS12 score. Additionally, the strength of the association between self-reported health care discrimination and lower MCS12 score was strongest for African descendants, then Mexican Americans, then other Latinos. These patterns may be explained by differences in how long a respondent has lived in the United States. Furthermore, the association of health care discrimination with lower MCS12 was weaker for recent immigrants. CONCLUSIONS Discrimination may be an important predictor of poor mental health status among Black and Latino immigrants. Previous findings of decreasing mental health status as immigrants acculturate might partly be related to experiences with racial discrimination.},

@article{Dillbary2019,
abstract = {This study is the first to empirically demonstrate widespread discrimination across the United States based on perceived sexual orientation, sex, and race in mortgage lending. Our analysis of over five million mortgage applications reveals that any Fair Housing Administration (FHA) loan application filed by same-sex male co-applicants is significantly less likely to be approved compared to the white heterosexual baseline (holding lending risk constant). The most likely explanation for this pattern is sexual orientation-based discrimination-despite the fact that FHA loans are the only type of loan in which discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is prohibited. Moreover, we find compelling evidence to support the intersectionality theory. According to this theory, when sex and race unite, a new form of discrimination emerges that cannot be explained by sexism or racism alone. The data unequivocally indicates that the race and sex of same-sex applicants play a role and result in a unique and previously unobserved pattern. This discriminatory pattern plagues every region in the United States, and it transcends party lines (that is, it is present in red, blue, and swing states). Furthermore, upending conventional wisdom, the data reveals that big banks discriminate at the same rate as small banks, and lenders in urban environments are as discriminatory as rural lenders. Prior studies failed to reveal this phenomenon due to data constraints and design flaws. These studies relied on testers posing as applicants, and none could investigate how intersectionality influences lending practices. Despite the grim results, a silver lining exists. We find that the pattern of discrimination diminishes or disappears in states and localities that pass anti-sexual orientation discrimination laws. These findings have important and timely implications. In 2017, a new bill offering nationwide protection from sexual orientation credit discrimination was introduced. The same year experienced tectonic changes in Title VII jurisprudence. Our study can reinvigorate the debate and help policymakers tailor remedies that would correct the discriminatory pattern this study unravels.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether analgesic administration in the out-of-hospital setting is influenced by the gender of the patient or the gender of the paramedic. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study of patient care records included adult patients (age {\textgreater} 15 years) with moderate to severe pain (verbal numerical rating score 4-10) treated by paramedics between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2009. Data extracted included patient pain severity score, analgesia provided by paramedics, and gender of the treating paramedic. Data was analyzed by descriptive statistics, $\chi$(2) test, and logistic regression. The primary outcome measures were the effect of patient and paramedic gender on analgesic administration. RESULTS: The study population comprised 42,051 patients, median age of 57 years (38-75); 50.4{\%} were female and 51{\%} were administered an analgesic agent. For the outcome of receiving any analgesia, neither patient gender nor paramedic gender was predictive (p = NS). In a multivariate model for the outcome of receiving any analgesia, patient gender, paramedic gender, and the interaction between patient and paramedic gender were all nonsignificant (p = NS). For the outcome of receiving opioid analgesia (i.e., morphine or fentanyl), male patients were at greater odds of receiving an opioid (OR 1.52, 95{\%} CI 1.29-1.79, p {\textless} 0.0001). Paramedic gender was not predictive of whether an opioid was given (p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: The gender of the paramedic did not appear to influence the odds of analgesic administration. Female patients were less likely to receive opioids. Paramedic gender does not explain this finding.},

@article{Bartik2017,
abstract = {With slower or no growth in the last 30 years in many Americans living standards, political pressure has increased for state and local policymakers to “do something” to improve job opportunities. Many state and local governments have responded with efforts to attract or increase local business activity via “economic development” policies, including lower business tax rates and higher “business incentives.” Such incentives provide targeted new or expanding businesses with special tax credits or other special financial benefits or services. Two examples of business incentives are property tax abatements, which reduce property taxes below normal property tax rates; and job creation tax credits (JCTCs), which provide tax benefits tied to jobs or payroll created. Despite the increase in such economic development policies, we have imprecise knowledge about how state and local incentives and business taxes vary across states, industries, and time. This lack of knowledge limits our ability to subject economic development policies to rigorous evaluation. If we don't know how large incentives are, whether they are going up or down, or how they vary in different places or for different industries, how can we subject incentives to an informed debate? This report addresses the gap in our data and knowledge by outlining a new database with better information on state and local business taxes and economic development incentives. For a firm locating a new facility in a particular state or city, the database estimates what state and local business taxes would be owed before considering economic development incentives, and what the facility would be eligible for in incentives. Although other databases previously have simulated the magnitude of state and local incentives and business taxes, this new database is distinguished by its breadth, covering more states, industries, and years. The database estimates, A New Panel Database on Business Incentives for Economic Development W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research 1 A New Panel Database on Business Incentives for Economic Development from 1990 to 2015, marginal business taxes and business incentives for 47 cities in 33 states for 45 industries for 26 years. The 33 states compose 92 percent of U.S. GDP, and the 45 industries compose 91 percent of U.S. labor compensation. The database also has more depth: it describes how business incentives vary over the term of a new business investment (from year 1 to year 20), and it breaks down incentives into different types, including JCTCs, property tax abatements, investment tax credits (ITCs), research and development (R{\&}D) tax credits, and customized job training. Therefore, this new database allows incentives to be subjected to more in-depth descriptive analyses. Such descriptive analysis can include examination of time trends in different types of incentives, and analysis of how incentives vary with a state's economic prosperity or with an industry's wage rates. With more precise knowledge of how incentives vary with states, industries, and time, the database also will permit better estimates of incentive effects. This report includes an explanation of how the database is constructed. It also subjects the database to some preliminary analyses to begin to answer questions about how incentives vary. Key conclusions from analyzing this new database include the following:  Business incentives are large. For “export-base” industries (industries that sell their goods and services outside the local economy), incentives for new or expanding businesses in 2015 had a present value that averaged 1.42 percent of business value- added, about 30 percent of average state and local business taxes. This incentive percentage leads to a projection that, for the entire nation, state and local business incentives had an annual cost in 2015 of {\$}45 billion. W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research 2 A New Panel Database on Business Incentives for Economic Development  Business incentives are insufficiently targeted in many states, although targeting is better in some states and has improved somewhat over time. Among export- base industries, incentives today for the average state do not vary as much as they should with industry characteristics that predict greater local benefits, such as industry wages, employment, and R{\&}D. For example, for each 10 percent increase in an industry's wages, average predicted incentives increase by only 3 percent. Industry wage variations are likely to be associated with greater variation than that in local benefits. However, some states do considerably better in targeting; for example, in some states a 10 percent increase in wages increases incentives by over 7 percent. In addition, back in 1990, a 10 percent increase in industry wages was only associated with an incentive increase of 1 percent.  Business incentives vary greatly by state. Even among adjacent states, business incentives often vary by a factor of 2- or 3-to-1. Incentives vary much more across states than across export-base industries. In many cases, states have higher incentives than nearby states, even though economic conditions are no worse and gross business taxes are similar or lower. A state's political culture and past practices seem to dictate incentives more than state economic and fiscal conditions.  Business incentives have more than tripled since 1990. However, the average national rate of increase has slowed since 2000, and in recent years some states have even subjected incentives to cutbacks.  On average in the nation, business incentives are concentrated more in the first years of a business investment, but are still large even after 5 or 10 years of an investment. Given the high discount rates businesses are likely to apply to incentives, W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research 3 A New Panel Database on Business Incentives for Economic Development longer-term incentives are less effective per dollar than shorter-term incentives in altering business decisions. States vary widely in the degree to which incentives are up front. On average in the nation, up-front incentives have increased over time.  Averaged over all states in the database, the biggest type of incentive is JCTCs, followed by property tax abatements. Together, these two types of incentives in 2015 made up over 70 percent of total incentive costs. Since 1990, the incentive type with the biggest increase has been JCTCs. Increased JCTCs make up two-thirds of the 1990–2015 increase in incentive costs.  Incentive costs can be significantly reduced by a wide variety of reforms. In addition to eliminating or limiting certain incentive types, simulations using the database show that incentive costs can be significantly reduced by restricting incentive “refundability,” that is, restricting the ability of businesses to receive incentives even if they have no state corporate income tax liability. Incentive costs can also be significantly lowered by reducing the term of incentives, that is, by restricting the incentives to the first few years of an investment. More modest effects on net business taxes are caused by changes in the rules for how business income is apportioned among states. However, changes in business apportionment rules have the potential to increase long-run business tax revenue but at a lower present value cost to businesses.  Preliminary work suggests that a state's incentives are not highly correlated with a state's fortunes. Incentives do not have a large correlation with a state's current or past unemployment or income levels, or with future economic growth. W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research 4 A New Panel Database on Business Incentives for Economic Development However, this preliminary work does not include many other control variables, which might alter results. The rest of this report is organized as follows. The next section provides context, including reviewing previous research. The methodology and data sources for this database are then outlined. The bulk of the report then uses the database to describe incentives and how they vary, by industry and state, over time, and by type of incentive. The report also considers how different policies alter net taxes after incentives, and describes some simple correlations between taxes, incentives, and state economic characteristics and trends.},

Across two audit experiments—one with politicians and another with students—as well as an online experiment (total n = 5,145), we test whether women and racial/ethnic minorities benefit from explicitly mentioning their demographic identity in requests for help, for example, by including statements like “As a Black woman{\ldots}” in their communications. We propose that when a help seeker highlights their marginalized identity, it may activate prospective helpers' motivations to avoid prejudiced reactions and increase their willingness to provide support. Here we show that when women and racial/ethnic minorities explicitly mentioned their demographic identity in help-seeking emails, politicians and students responded 24.4{\%} (7.42 percentage points) and 79.6{\%} (2.73 percentage points) more often, respectively. These findings suggest that deliberately mentioning identity in requests for help can improve outcomes for women and racial/ethnic minorities.},

These improvements in access lead to more office visits, better self-reported health, and reduced school absenteeism.

Yet carpooling is indispensable for many minorities because they face severe economic inequalities. In order to test for ethnic discrimination in the carpooling market, we conducted a correspondence test. We sent out requests from four fictitious user profiles to drivers listed on one of Germany's carpooling websites. All users were aged mid-20s: two males and two females. One man and one woman had German names, the second set had Turkish names. In total, we collected 952 observations. Our field experiment reveals substantial discrimination by ethnicity and gender. Whereas women with German names are least likely to experience discrimination, men with Turkish names are the most likely to be discriminated against. At first sight, counterintuitively but in line with ethnic competition theory, users with Turkish names are not significantly more discriminated against by drivers on routes in East Germany where xenophobia is more prevalent compared with West Germany.},

@incollection{Tang2017,
abstract = {Relative to the randomized controlled trial (RCT), the basic regression discontinuity (RD) design suffers from lower statistical power and lesser ability to generalize causal estimates away from the treatment eligibility cutoff. This chapter seeks to mitigate these limitations by adding an untreated outcome comparison function that is measured along all or most of the assignment variable. When added to the usual treated and untreated outcomes observed in the basic RD, a comparative RD (CRD) design results. One version of CRD adds a pretest measure of the study outcome (CRD-Pre); another adds posttest outcomes from a nonequivalent comparison group (CRD-CG). We describe how these designs can be used to identify unbiased causal effects away from the cutoff under the assumption that a common, stable functional form describes how untreated outcomes vary with the assignment variable, both in the basic RD and in the added outcomes data (pretests or a comparison group's posttest). We then create the two CRD designs using data from the National Head Start Impact Study, a large-scale RCT. For both designs, we find that all untreated outcome functions are parallel, which lends support to CRD's identifying assumptions. Our results also indicate that CRD-Pre and CRD-CG both yield impact estimates at the cutoff that have a similarly small bias as, but are more precise than, the basic RD's impact estimates. In addition, both CRD designs produce estimates of impacts away from the cutoff that have relatively little bias compared to estimates of the same parameter from the RCT design. This common finding appears to be driven by two different mechanisms. In this instance of CRD-CG, potential untreated outcomes were likely independent of the assignment variable from the start. This was not the case with CRD-Pre. However, fitting a model using the observed pretests and untreated posttests to account for the initial dependence generated an accurate prediction of the missing counterfactual. The result was an unbiased causal estimate away from the cutoff, conditional on this successful prediction of the untreated outcomes of the treated.},

Next the Article looks at the possibility of adding polyamory to current statutory definitions of sexual orientation, examining whether polyamory is a sufficiently embedded identity to be considered a sexual orientation and the degree of discrimination that polyamorists face. After concluding that such an expansion would be reasonable, the Article briefly outlines some issues for further investigation, including potential policy implications and the conflicting evidence as to whether polyamorists want specific legal protections.},

The results show that campaign by incumbents and challengers are more expenditures when candidates run in states with contribution to in limits, productive campaign as opposed states without limits. In states with contribution incumbent limits, spending and challenger spending are equally productive, and spending by both candidates is quantitatively important in increasing their vote shares. 1.

abstract = {In the last few years, transgender and gender nonconforming people have become more visible in our society, which has sparked a marked increase in awareness, interest, and attention among psychologists. Questions have emerged about the extent to which psychologists are able to work competently with this population. This article presents a framework for understanding key clinical issues that psychologists who work with transgender and gender nonconforming individuals will likely encounter in their clinical work. This article does not address the knowledge and skills required to provide services to gender transition, but rather to provide other psychological services that these clients may need, in light of the high levels of gender-related victimization and discrimination to which they are exposed. An adaptation of the Minority Stress Model (Myer, 2003) is presented and translated to incorporate the unique experiences encountered by transgender and gender nonconforming individuals. In particular, we examine adverse expectations for future victimization or rejection, and internalized transphobia. The impact of Minority Stress Model factors on suicide attempts is presented as a detailed example. Mechanisms by which transgender and gender nonconforming persons develop resilience to the negative psychological effects of these adverse experiences are also discussed. Recommendations for clinicians are then made to assist psychologists in developing competence in working with this population.},

Taken at face value, our estimates imply that differential treatment accounts for at least one-third of the black-white wage gap.

In the present work state variation in the timing of the removal of surgical requirements is exploited within a triple difference framework to analyse the causal impact of these removals on the employment of transgender people, for the first time. The findings highlight that removing surgical requirements for transgender people to be able to reassign gender on birth certificates increases the employment of female to male transgender people, but has no effect on male to female or gender non-conforming transgender people.},

abstract = {Objective: Racial discrimination is a social determinant of health for First Nations people. Cultural resilience has been regarded as a potentially positive resource for social outcomes. Using a compensatory model of resilience, this study sought to determine if cultural resilience (compensatory factor) neutralized or offset the detrimental effect of racial discrimination (social risk factor) on stress (outcome). Methods: Data were collected from October 2012 to February 2013 (N = 340) from adult members of the Kettle and Stony Point First Nation community in Ontario, Canada. The outcome was perceived stress; risk factor, racial discrimination; and compensatory factor, cultural resilience. Control variables included individual (education, sociability) and family (marital status, socioeconomic status) resilience resources and demographics (age and gender). The model was tested using sequential regression. Results: The risk factor, racial discrimination, increased stress across steps of the sequential model, while cultural resilience had an opposite modest effect on stress levels. In the final model with all variables, age and gender were significant, with the former having a negative effect on stress and women reporting higher levels of stress than males. Education, marital status, and socioeconomic status (household income) were not significant in the model. The model had R2 = 0.21 and adjusted R2 = 0.18 and semipartial correlation (squared) of 0.04 and 0.01 for racial discrimination and cultural resilience, respectively. Conclusions: In this study, cultural resilience compensated for the detrimental effect of racial discrimination on stress in a modest manner. These findings may support the development of programs and services fostering First Nations culture, pending further study. Copyright {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract = {This paper takes a broad, pragmatic view of statistical inference to include all aspects of model formulation. The estimation of model parameters traditionally assumes that a model has a prespecified known form and takes no account of possible uncertainty regarding the model structure. This implicitly assumes the existence of a 'true' model, which many would regard as a fiction. In practice model uncertainty is a fact of life and likely to be more serious than other sources of uncertainty which have received far more attention from statisticians. This is true whether the model is specified on subject-matter grounds or, as is increasingly the case, when a model is formulated, fitted and checked on the same data set in an iterative, interactive way. Modern computing power allows a large number of models to be considered and data-dependent specification searches have become the norm in many areas of statistics. The term data mining may be used in this context when the analyst goes to great lengths to obtain a good fit. This paper reviews the effects of model uncertainty, such as too narrow prediction intervals, and the non-trivial biases in parameter estimates which can follow data-based modelling. Ways of assessing and overcoming the effects of model uncertainty are discussed, including the use of simulation and resampling methods, a Bayesian model averaging approach and collecting additional data wherever possible. Perhaps the main aim of the paper is to ensure that statisticians are aware of the problems and start addressing the issues even if there is no simple, general theoretical fix.},

This paper reports on a large-scale randomized field experiment in which research subjects having difficulty making a decision flipped a coin to help determine their choice. For important decisions (e.g. quitting a job or ending a relationship), those who make a change (regardless of the outcome of the coin toss) report being substantially happier two months and six months later. This correlation, however, need not reflect a causal impact. To assess causality, I use the outcome of a coin toss. Individuals who are told by the coin toss to make a change are much more likely to make a change and are happier six months later than those who were told by the coin to maintain the status quo. The results of this paper suggest that people may be excessively cautious when facing life-changing choices.},

Yet the evidence on the effectiveness of such programs is mixed, and prior research suffers from selection bias. However, recent school reform efforts in Chicago provide an opportunity to examine the causal impact of these remedial education programs. In 1996, the Chicago Public Schools insti- tuted an accountability policy that tied summer school and promotional decisions to performance on standardized tests, which resulted in a highly nonlinear relationship between current achievement and the probability of attending summer school or being retained. Using a regression disconti- nuity design, we find that the net effect of these programs was to substantially increase academic achievement among third-graders, but not sixth-graders. In addition, contrary to conventional wisdom and prior research, we find that retention increases achievement for third-grade students and has little effect on math achievement for sixth-grade students.},

abstract = {Using interviews, a laboratory experiment, and a r{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}} audit study, we examine racial minorities' attempts to avoid anticipated discrimination in labor markets by concealing or downplaying racial cues in job applications, a practice known as “r{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}} whitening.” Interviews with racial minority university students reveal that while some minority job seekers reject this practice, others view it as essential and use a variety of whitening techniques. Building on the qualitative findings, we conduct a lab study to examine how racial minority job seekers change their r{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}}s in response to different job postings. Results show that when targeting an employer that presents itself as valuing diversity, minority job applicants engage in relatively little r{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}} whitening and thus submit more racially transparent r{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}}s. Yet our audit study of how employers respond to whitened and unwhitened r{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}}s shows that organizational diversity statements are not actually associated with reduced discrimination against unwhitened r{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}}s. Taken together, these findings suggest a paradox: minorities may be particularly likely to experience disadvantage when they apply to ostensibly pro-diversity employers. These findings illuminate the role of racial concealment and transparency in modern labor markets and point to an important interplay between the self-presentation of employers and the self-presentation of job seekers in shaping economic inequality.},

abstract = {This article reports the findings of research into the functioning of companies' and organisations' internal labour markets. Four case studies of Australian and United Kingdom public and private sector organisations have been undertaken with two principal aims: to elucidate the challenges and barriers to the employ- ment of older workers, and to demonstrate the benefits to business and to older workers of age-aware human resource management policies. In each of the case- study organisations, age-related assumptions affected the management of knowl- edge and skills and the ways in which older and younger workers were employed. Managing age relations in organisations requires an understanding of the ways in which workers of different ages are perceived and how these associate with sub- optimal deployment. The article concludes by suggesting that policies directed at older workers alone will ignore the age and age-group dynamics that pervade workplaces. To promote the better deployment of younger and older individuals in rapidly transforming organisations, there is a need for policy makers, employers and employees to be attentive to the age-group relationships that currently inform workplace practices. Organisations cannot ignore these age dynamics, but should adopt ‘age aware' rather than ‘age free' practices. The recommended human- resources approach would attend to individuals' capabilities and not stereotype them by age.},

abstract = {In a sharp regression-discontinuity design (RDD) the participation status deterministically depends on whether a pre-programme characteristic is above or below a specified threshold. The attractiveness of such a design rests on close similarities with a formal experiment. Nevertheless, it is of limited applicability since participation into a programme is seldom determined according to this rule. Besides, in the presence of heterogeneous effects a sharp RDD only allows identification of mean effects for individuals around the threshold for participation. Two results are presented in this paper, and they both partially overcome the two limitations described above. We show that when individuals self-select into participation conditional on some eligibility criteria a sharp RDD provides a natural framework to define a specification test for the non-experimental estimation of programme effects for participants away from the threshold. We also show that, in this set-up, the regularity conditions required for the identification of the mean counterfactual outcome for participants marginally eligible for the programme are essentially the same as in a sharp RDD. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Building on job market signaling theory, this study investigated whether older applicants may benefit from concealing explicitly mentioned age signals on their resumes (date of birth) or whether more implicit/subtle age cues on resumes (older-sounding names/old-fashioned extracurricular activities) may lower older applicants' hirability rating. An experimental study among 610 HR professionals using a mixed factorial design showed hiring discrimination of older applicants based on implicit age cues in resumes. This effect was more pronounced for older raters. Concealing one's date of birth led to overall lower ratings. Study findings add to the limited knowledge on the effects of implicit age cues on hiring discrimination in resume screening and the usefulness of anonymous resume screening in the context of age.

abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between Hong Kong Chinese people's contact with transgender/transsexual (TG/TS) people and attitudes toward transgenderism and transgender civil rights, based on Allport's Contact Hypothesis. The term transprejudice is introduced to refer to the negative valuing, stereotyping and discriminatory treatment of TG/TS people. Data are presented from a population-based survey with a random sample of 856 Hong Kong Chinese persons aged between 15 and 64, using the Chinese Attitudes towards Transgenderism and Transgender Civil Rights Scale (CATTCRS). Attitudes, assessed on both personal and institutional dimensions, are examined in relation to participants' gender, age, educational level, religiosity, and previous contact with transpeople. Results suggest that previous contact with transpeople was significantly associated with attitudes reflected in the scale; decreased social distance, decreased social discrimination, and decreased transprejudice, increased awareness of discrimination against transpeople, increased support for equal opportunities, increased support for post-operative transsexual civil rights, and increased support for anti-discrimination legislation. Our findings support the contact hypothesis, that contact has a positive effect on attitudes towards TG/TS persons. We discuss the implications of these findings for public education interventions and public policy, as well as for research.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Approximately 50{\%} of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder attempt suicide, and approximately 10{\%} die of suicide. Study results suggest that clozapine therapy significantly reduces suicidal behavior in these patients. METHODS: A multicenter, randomized, international, 2-year study comparing the risk for suicidal behavior in patients treated with clozapine vs olanzapine was conducted in 980 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, 26.8{\%} of whom were refractory to previous treatment, who were considered at high risk for suicide because of previous suicide attempts or current suicidal ideation. To equalize clinical contact across treatments, all patients were seen weekly for 6 months and then biweekly for 18 months. Subsequent to randomization, unmasked clinicians at each site could make any interventions necessary to prevent the occurrence of suicide attempts. Suicidal behavior was assessed at each visit. Primary end points included suicide attempts (including those that led to death), hospitalizations to prevent suicide, and a rating of "much worsening of suicidality" from baseline. Masked raters, including an independent suicide monitoring board, determined when end point criteria were achieved. RESULTS: Suicidal behavior was significantly less in patients treated with clozapine vs olanzapine (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.58-0.97; P =.03). Fewer clozapine-treated patients attempted suicide (34 vs 55; P =.03), required hospitalizations (82 vs 107; P =.05) or rescue interventions (118 vs 155; P =.01) to prevent suicide, or required concomitant treatment with antidepressants (221 vs 258; P =.01) or anxiolytics or soporifics (301 vs 331; P =.03). Overall, few of these high-risk patients died of suicide during the study (5 clozapine vs 3 olanzapine-treated patients; P =.73). CONCLUSIONS: Clozapine therapy demonstrated superiority to olanzapine therapy in preventing suicide attempts in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder at high risk for suicide. Use of clozapine in this population should lead to a significant reduction in suicidal behavior.},

The results point to the limited effects of concordance in general but illuminate for whom concordance matters most. The results encourage more nuanced and contingent theories. They suggest that racial/ethnic concordance holds little salience in the minds of most black and Latino patients and that discordance has little effect. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that concordance has a positive effect among those who prefer concordance-thus the apparent effects of concordance might reflect the effects of patient choice more than concordance per se. The conclusion sketches policy implications, including the merits of promoting concordance among targeted groups of patients, even in the absence of overall effects on disparities.},

The majority focused on racial bias in the USA, while the few experiments outside the USA were usually single-country studies. We explore gender bias with the first large-scale audit experiment in five countries in Europe (France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Netherlands) and six in Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Uruguay). A citizen alias whose gender is randomized contacts members of parliament about unemployment benefits or healthcare services. The results are surprising. Legislators respond significantly more to women (+3{\%} points), especially in Europe (+4.3{\%} points). In Europe, female legislators in particular reply substantially more to women (+8.4{\%} points).},

Using a control function approach, I find that one-standard deviation in the potential replacement rate from UI (about 12.5 percentage points) discourages on-the-job search by 0.55 percentage points, thereby reducing the probability of starting a new job at a different employer. This average effect is small because UI does not affect the search behaviour of workers who do not believe to be at risk of job loss, the majority of the employed population over 50. In contrast, a one-standard deviation increase in the potential replacement rate reduces the probability of on-the-job-search by as much as 3.5 percentage points for workers who state a 90{\%} probability of losing their jobs. I also find suggestive evidence that this effect decreases with wages, although the estimated effects across quartiles of the wage distribution are not statistically different from each other. I also find that UI discourages on-the-job search in similar magnitudes for men and women, although the effects are only statistically significant for men.},

abstract = {Discrimination in the housing market may create large economic inefficiencies and unfair individual outcomes, but is very difficult to measure. To circumvent the problems with unobserved heterogeneity, most recent studies use the correspondence testing approach (i.e. sending fictitious inquiries to landlords). In this study, we generalize the existing methodology in order to facilitate a test of to what extent the measured degree of discrimination depends on applicant, landlord/apartment, and regional characteristics. To show how this more general methodology can be implemented, we investigate the effects of gender, ethnicity, age, and employment status in the Swedish rental market for apartments. Our results confirm the existence of widespread discrimination against some of the groups, but also show that the degree of discrimination varies substantially with landlord, apartment, and regional characteristics. This heterogeneity highlights the importance of using a broad approach when conducting correspondence studies. Our results also allow us to interpret the nature of discrimination and how it relates to segregation and geographical sorting. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

For White participants (n=10 435), pooled results did not detect a net discrimination for or against White targets, but, for Black participants (n=2781), pooled results indicated the presence of a small-to-moderate net discrimination in favor of Black targets; inferences were the same for the subset of studies that had a political candidate target and the subset of studies that had a worker or job applicant target. These results have implications for understanding racial discrimination in the United States, and, given that some of the studies have never been fully reported on in a journal or academic book, the results also suggest the need for preregistration to reduce or eliminate publication bias in racial discrimination studies.},

We focus on a setting where the outcome distributions may be thick tailed, where treatment effects are small, where sample sizes are large and where assignment is completely random. This setting is of particular interest in recent experimentation in tech companies. We propose using parametric models for the treatment effects, as opposed to parametric models for the full outcome distributions. This leads to semiparametric models for the outcome distributions. We derive the semiparametric efficiency bound for this setting, and propose efficient estimators. In the case with a constant treatment effect one of the proposed estimators has an interesting interpretation as a weighted average of quantile treatment effects, with the weights proportional to (minus) the second derivative of the log of the density of the potential outcomes. Our analysis also results in an extension of Huber's model and trimmed mean to include asymmetry and a simplified condition on linear combinations of order statistics, which may be of independent interest.},

abstract = {There has been increasing interest recently inmodel averagingwithin the frequentist paradigm. Themain benefit ofmodel averaging overmodel selection is that it incorporates rather than ignores the uncertainty inherent in themodel selection process. One of themost important, yet challenging, aspects of model averaging is how to optimally combine estimates from different models. In this work, we suggest a procedure of weight choice for frequentist model average estimators that exhibits optimality properties with respect to the estimatorsmean squared error (MSE). As a basis for demonstrating our idea, we consider averaging over a sequence of linear regression models. Building on this base, we develop a model weighting mechanism that involves minimizing the trace of an unbiased estimator of the model average estimators MSE. We further obtain results that reflect the finite sample aswell as asymptotic optimality of the proposedmechanism. AMonte Carlo study based on simulated and real data evaluates and compares the finite sample properties of thismechanism with those of existingmethods. The extension of the proposed weight selection scheme to general likelihood models is also considered. This article has supplementary material online.},

The analysis is conducted separately at the zipcode, county, and state levels. Results indicate that proxies for labor market pooling have the most robust effect, positively influencing agglomeration at all levels of geography. Proxies for knowledge spillovers, in contrast, positively affect agglomeration only at the zipcode level. Reliance on manufactured inputs or natural resources positively affects agglomeration at the state level but has little effect on agglomeration at lower levels of geography. The same is true for the perishability of output, a proxy for product shipping costs.},

abstract = {Childhood lead exposure can lead to psychological traits that are strongly associated with aggressive and criminal behavior. In the late 1970s in the United States, lead was removed from gasoline under the Clean Air Act. I use the state-specific reductions in lead exposure that resulted from this removal to identify the effect of childhood lead exposure on crime rates. The elasticity of violent crime with respect to childhood lead exposure is estimated to be 0.8, and this result is robust to numerous sensitivity tests. Mixed evidence supports an effect of lead exposure on murder rates, and little evidence indicates an effect of lead on property crime. Overall, I find that the reduction in childhood lead exposure in the late 1970s and early 1980s was responsible for significant declines in violent crime in the 1990s and may cause further declines in the future. Moreover, the social value of the reductions in violent crime far exceeds the cost of the removal of lead from gasoline. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2007 The Berkeley Electronic Press.

Sequential logistic regressions were used to examine the relative contribution of income and education to racial disparities. RESULTS Ninety percent of the Black-White difference in disability rates for men and 75{\%} of the difference for women aged 55 to 64 were explained by income and education. DISCUSSION The greatly elevated risk of disability among Blacks aged 55 to 74 is largely explained by differences in socioeconomic status. Reductions in Black-White health disparities require a better understanding of the mechanisms whereby lower income and education are associated with functional outcomes in older persons.},

abstract = {Affirmative care with transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) children and adolescents is a new framework under which many mental health clinicians now practice. It rests on a premise that appreciates diverse gender expressions and identities within society, and encourages the highest potential for individuals to follow their own paths to positive emotional well-being. Scientific understanding of the phenomenology of gender development in children and adolescents is scarce, and the gaps in knowledge limit evidence-based practice when working with these youths. Interventions span many domains within the physical and mental health realms, calling for providers to navigate differing interdisciplinary perspectives when optimizing assessment and treatment goals. In addition, interventions differ according to developmental stage, and newer approaches and treatments have become more popular within the last decade. For children, the concept of social gender transition has remained controversial, as relatively historical approaches (discouraging cross-gender behavior) have become outdated and more recent methods (supporting gender transition) have gained backing. Fully reversible pubertal suppression has been introduced for TGNC adolescents as a means of buying time for exploration without the pressures of irreversible pubertal advancement. Given the current deficits in scientific understanding of gender-identity development in youth, the affirmative provider often faces decisions that are challenging, complex, and unclear. This paper describes the theoretical approaches to TGNC youth across development, provides a brief overview of the current research, and offers providers a way to conceptualize and provide care that can be both supportive and scientifically driven when done in a thoughtful, balanced way.

abstract = {The increasing popularity of regression discontinuity methods for causal inference in observational studies has led to a proliferation of different estimating strategies, most of which involve first fitting nonparametric regression models on both sides of a treatment assignment boundary and then reporting plug-in estimates for the effect of interest. In applications, however, it is often difficult to tune the nonparametric regressions in a way that is well calibrated for the specific target of inference; for example, the model with the best global in-sample fit may provide poor estimates of the discontinuity parameter, which depends on the regression function at boundary points. We propose an alternative method for estimation and statistical inference in regression discontinuity designs that uses numerical convex optimization to directly obtain the finite-sample-minimax linear estimator for the regression discontinuity parameter, subject to bounds on the second derivative of the conditional response function. Given a bound on the second derivative, our proposed method is fully data driven and provides uniform confidence intervals for the regression discontinuity parameter with both discrete and continuous running variables. The method also naturally extends to the case of multiple running variables.},

abstract = {Racial differences exist in analgesic prescribing to children during emergency department and ambulatory surgery visits in the USA; however, it is unknown whether this is true in the outpatient setting. We examined racial and ethnic differences in outpatient analgesic prescribing using nationally representative data from 113,929 children from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. We also examined whether patient-provider race and ethnic concordance was associated with opioid prescribing. White children were more commonly prescribed opioids as compared to minorities (3.0{\%} vs. 0.9-1.7{\%}), except for Native American children who had similar rates of opioid prescribing (2.6{\%}) as white children. Minorities were more likely to receive non-opioid analgesics than white children (2.0-5.7{\%} vs. 1.3{\%}). While most white children had race-concordant providers (93.5{\%}), only 34.3{\%} of black children, and 42.7{\%} of Hispanic children had race-concordant providers. Among black children, having a race concordant usual source of care provider was associated with a decreased likelihood of receiving an opioid prescription as compared to having a white usual source of care provider [AOR(95{\%}C.I.)=0.51(0.30-0.87)]. For all other racial groups, patient-provider race-concordance was not associated with likelihood of opioid prescription. Racial differences exist in analgesic prescriptions to children at outpatient health care visits in the USA, with white children more likely to receive opioids, and minorities more likely to receive non-opioid analgesics. Health care providers' race and ethnicity may play a significant role in extant analgesic differences. Further work should focus on understanding the role of provider race and ethnicity in analgesic differences to children in the USA.},

In present value terms, men lose an average of 1.4 years of re-displacement earnings if displaced in mass layoff events that occur when the national unemployment rate is below 6 percent. They lose a staggering 2.8 years of pre-displacement earnings if displaced when the unemployment rate exceeds 8 percent. These results reflect discounting at a 5{\%} annual rate over 20 years after displacement. We also document large cyclical movements in the incidence of job loss and job displacement and present evidence on how worker anxieties about job loss, wage cuts and job opportunities respond to contemporaneous economic conditions. Finally, we confront leading models of unemployment fluctuations with evidence on the present value earnings losses associated with job displacement. The model of Mortensen and Pissarides (1994) extended to include search on the job generates present value losses less than one-fourth as large as observed losses. Moreover, present value losses in the model vary little with aggregate conditions at the time of displacement, unlike the pattern in the data.

We examine this through an empirical analysis of the entertainment industry across US metropolitan areas from 1970 to 2000. Our findings indicate that geographies of scope (or collocation among key related entertainment subsectors and inputs) explain much of the economic geography of entertainment even when scale is controlled for, though our regressions over time suggest the role of scope is decreasing. Furthermore, we find that the entertainment sector as a whole and its key subsectors are significantly concentrated in two superstar cities‚{\"{A}}{\^{i}}New York and Los Angeles‚{\"{A}}{\^{i}}far beyond what their population size (or scale effects) can account for, while the pattern falls off dramatically for other large regions.},

We examined whether racial discrimination restricts ethnic–racial minority access to high-achieving STEM schools. We conducted an audit correspondence experiment to investigate racial discrimination in guidance counselor responsiveness to 976 emails from fictitious Asian, Black, Latina, and White mothers inquiring about school enrollment. Moderation analyses revealed that guidance counselors restricted access from Asian mothers at schools characterized as rural, lower socioeconomic status, and higher STEM prestige—evidence of gatekeeping points to the restriction of Asian students from advanced STEM opportunities. Results are situated within educational audit experiments to objectively document how racism from multiple facets of the education system intersect to inhibit ethnic–racial minority youth.},

We use panel data on states, treating the age structure of the population as endogenous, owing to migration. When older cohorts (50–59 or 60–69) are large relative to a young cohort (aged 16–24), the evidence fits the relative supply hypothesis. However, when older cohorts are large relative to 25- to 49-year-olds, the evidence points to a relative demand shift. Thus, we need a more nuanced view than simply whether the older cohort is large relative to the population: the cohort that they are large relative to matters.},

The product of the panel's deliberations was a report that laid out a set of recommended guidelines for CV survey design, administration, and data analysis. This paper focuses on one of these guidelines -- the Panel's call for the "temporal averaging" of willingness-to-pay (WTP) responses obtained from CV surveys as one method for increasing their reliability. The panel suggested: "Time dependent measurement noise should be reduced by averaging across independently drawn samples taken at different points in time. A clear and substantial time trend in the responses would cast doubt on the 'reliability' of the finding."},

Usually, a regression equation$\backslash$nbased on a few variables will be more accurate and certainly simpler.$\backslash$nThere are various methods for picking "good" subsets of variables,$\backslash$nand programs that do such procedures are part of every widely used$\backslash$nstatistical package. The most common methods are based on stepwise$\backslash$naddition or deletion of variables and on "best subsets." The latter$\backslash$nrefers to a search method that, given the number of variables to$\backslash$nbe in the equation (say, five), locates that regression equation$\backslash$nbased on five variables that has the lowest residual sum of squares$\backslash$namong all five variable equations All of these procedures generate$\backslash$na sequence of regression equations, the first based on one variable,$\backslash$nthe next based on two variables, and so on. Each member of this sequence$\backslash$nis called a submodel and the number of variables in the equation$\backslash$nis the dimensionality of the submodel. A complex problem is determining$\backslash$nwhich submodel of the generated sequence to select. Statistical packages$\backslash$nuse various ad hoc selection methods, including F to enter, F to$\backslash$ndelete, C(p), and t-value cutoffs. Our approach to this problem is$\backslash$nthrough the criterion that a good selection procedure selects dimensionality$\backslash$nso as to give low prediction error (PE), where the PE of a regression$\backslash$nequation is its expected squared error over the points in the X design.$\backslash$nBecause the true PE is unknown, the use of this criteria must be$\backslash$nbased on PE estimates. We introduce a method called the little bootstrap,$\backslash$nwhich gives almost unbiased estimates for submodel PEs and then uses$\backslash$nthese to do submodel selection. Comparison is made to C(p) and other$\backslash$nmethods by analytic examples and simulations. Little bootstrap does$\backslash$nwell-C(p) and, by implication, all selection methods not based on$\backslash$ndata reuse give highly biased results and poor subset selection.},

We argue that the patterns in the data are consistent with a model in which police officers are utility maximizers, a fraction of which have a preference for discrimination, who incur relatively high expected costs of officer-involved shootings.},

abstract = {Many researchers use unit fixed effects regression models as their default methods for causal inference with longitudinal data. We show that the ability of these models to adjust for unobserved time‐invariant confounders comes at the expense of dynamic causal relationships, which are permitted under an alternative selection‐on‐observables approach. Using the nonparametric directed acyclic graph, we highlight two key causal identification assumptions of unit fixed effects models: Past treatments do not directly influence current outcome, and past outcomes do not affect current treatment. Furthermore, we introduce a new nonparametric matching framework that elucidates how various unit fixed effects models implicitly compare treated and control observations to draw causal inference. By establishing the equivalence between matching and weighted unit fixed effects estimators, this framework enables a diverse set of identification strategies to adjust for unobservables in the absence of dynamic causal relationships between treatment and outcome variables. We illustrate the proposed methodology through its application to the estimation of GATT membership effects on dyadic trade volume.},

In consensually non-monogamous (CNM) relationships, needs are dispersed among multiple partners. Using Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and dyadic data from 56 CNM partnerships (112 individuals), we tested how sexual motives and need fulfillment were linked to relational outcomes. We drew from models of need fulfillment to explore how sexual motives with a second partner were associated with satisfaction in the primary relationship. In a cross-sectional and daily experience study we demonstrated that self-determined reasons for sex were positively associated with sexual satisfaction and indirectly linked through sexual need fulfillment. Self-determined reasons for sex predicted need fulfillment for both partners at a three-month follow up. The association between sexual motives and need fulfillment was stronger on days when participants engaged in sex with an additional partner, though this was not related to satisfaction in the primary relationship. Implications for need fulfillment are discussed.},

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to ascertain whether older women's current and anticipated future labor force patterns have changed over time, and if so, to evaluate the factors associated with longer work lives and plans to continue work at older ages. Using data from both the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the National Financial Capability Study (NFCS), we show that older women's current and intended future labor force attachment patterns are changing over time. Specifically, compared to our 1992 HRS baseline, more recent cohorts of women in their 50's and 60s's are more likely to plan to work longer. When we explore the reasons for delayed retirement among older women, factors include education, more marital disruption, and fewer children than prior cohorts. But household finances also play a key role, in that older women today have more debt than previously and are more financially fragile than in the past. The NFCS data show that factors associated with retirement planning include having more education and greater financial literacy. Those who report excessive amounts of debt and are financially fragile are the least financially literate, had more dependent children, and experienced income shocks. Thus shocks do play a role in older women's debt status, but it is not enough to have resources: people also need the capacity to manage those resources if they are to stay out of debt as they head into retirement.},

abstract = {Schools and teachers are often said to be a source of stereotypes that harm girls. This paper tests for the existence of gender stereotyping and discrimination by public high-school teachers in Israel. It uses a natural experiment based on blind and non-blind scores that students receive on matriculation exams in their senior year. Using data on test results in several subjects in the humanities and sciences, I found, contrary to expectations, that male students face discrimination in each subject. These biases widen the female-male achievement difference because girls outperform boys in all subjects, except English, and at all levels of the curriculum. The bias is evident in all segments of the ability and performance distribution and is robust to various individual controls. Several explanations based on differential behavior between boys and girls are not supported empirically. However, the size of the difference is very sensitive to teachers' characteristics, suggesting that the bias against male students is the result of teachers', and not students', behavior. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Psychological Association. Research has revealed alarmingly high rates of suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts among transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) people. This study aims to analyze the role of factors from the gender minority stress and resilience (GMSR) model (Testa, Habarth, Peta, Balsam,  {\&}  Bockting, 2015), the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide (IPTS; Joiner, 2005; Van Orden et al., 2010), and the potential integration of these factors, in explaining SI in this population. A convenience sample of 816 TGNC adults responded to measures of current SI, gender minority stressors, and IPTS factors. Path analysis was utilized to test 2 models. Model 1 evaluated the associations between external minority stressors and SI through internal minority stressors. Model 2 examined the relationships between internal minority stressors and SI through IPTS variables (perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness). All GMSR external stressors (rejection, nonaffirmation, victimization, and discrimination), internal stressors (internalized transphobia, negative expectations, and nondisclosure), and IPTS factors (thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness) were related to SI. Both models demonstrated good fit. Model 1 revealed that rejection, nonaffirmation, and victimization were related to SI through experiences of internalized transphobia and negative expectations. Model 2 indicated that internalized transphobia and negative expectations were associated with SI through IPTS factors. The models demonstrate pathways through which GMSR and IPTS constructs relate to one another and confer risk for SI among TGNC individuals. These pathways and several recently proposed constructs examined here provide promising directions for future research and clinical interventions in this area.},

We start by discussing what we know about how older workers faired in prior recessions in the United States and how COVID-19 and this recession may differ. We then estimate some early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and recession on employment and unemployment rates by age group and sex using Current Population Survey data. We calculate employment and unemployment rates multiple ways to account for the complicated employment situation and possible errors in survey enumeration. We find that while previous recessions, in some ways, did not affect employment outcomes for older workers as much, this recession disproportionately affected older workers of ages 65 and older. For example, we find that unemployment rates in April 2020 increased to 15.43{\%} for those ages 65 and older, compared to 12.99{\%} for those ages 25-44. We also find that COVID-19 and the recession disproportionately affected women, where women have reached higher unemployment rates than men, which was consistent for all age groups and unemployment rate measures we used.},

@article{Mogstad2018,
abstract = {We propose a method for using instrumental variables (IV) to draw inference about causal effects for individuals other than those affected by the instrument at hand. Policy relevance and external validity turns on the ability to do this reliably. Our method exploits the insight that both the IV estimand and many treatment parameters can be expressed as weighted averages of the same underlying marginal treatment effects. Since the weights are known or identified, knowledge of the IV estimand generally places some restrictions on the unknown marginal treatment effects, and hence on the values of the treatment parameters of interest. We show how to extract information about the average effect of interest from the IV estimand, and, more generally, from a class of IV-like estimands that includes the two stage least squares and ordinary least squares estimands, among many others. Our method has several applications. First, it can be used to construct nonparametric bounds on the average causal effect of a hypothetical policy change. Second, our method allows the researcher to flexibly incorporate shape restrictions and parametric assumptions, thereby enabling extrapolation of the average effects for compliers to the average effects for different or larger populations. Third, our method can be used to test model specification and hypotheses about behavior, such as no selection bias and/or no selection on gain. To accommodate these diverse applications, we devise a novel inference procedure that is designed to exploit the convexity of our setting. We develop uniformly valid tests that allow for an infinite number of IV--like estimands and a general convex parameter space. We apply our method to analyze the effects of price subsidies on the adoption and usage of an antimalarial bed net in Kenya. Magne},

Despite their focus on diverse genders and sexualities, campus climate research does not usually report the experiences of staff and students with diverse relationship styles. In this article, I analyse some of the data gathered for a larger campus climate project, which was conducted at an Aotearoa/New Zealand university campus. While this project reviewed gender, sex and sexuality more broadly, I focus here on staff and student experiences of being non-monogamous and/or polyamorous in the university context. I base my analysis on data drawn from one interview, as well as 13 qualitative survey responses from staff and students who identified as non-monogamous and/or polyamorous. Many, but not all, participants had intersecting identities and used multiple labels to describe their genders and sexualities. Primarily, participants reported that being non-monogamous and/or polyamorous was the hardest identity label to discuss, due to the higher potential for negative repercussions from other staff and students. The experiences shared in this article reinforce the hugely prevalent discourse that insists long-term (heterosexual) monogamy is the ideal for all relationships.},

abstract = {Twenty-two million families currently receive a total of {\$}34 billion dollars in benefits from the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). In fact, the EITC is the largest cash transfer program for lower-income families at the federal level. An unusual feature of the credit is its explicit goal to use the tax system to encourage and support those who choose to work. A large body of work has evaluated the labor supply effects the EITC and has generated several important findings regarding the behavioral response to taxes. Perhaps the main lesson learned from the evidence is the confirmation that real responses to taxes are important; labor supply does respond to the EITC. The second major lesson is related to the nature of the labor supply response. A consistent finding is that labor supply responses are concentrated along the extensive (entry) margin, rather than the intensive (hours worked) margin. This distinction has important implications for the design of tax-transfer programs and for the welfare evaluation of tax reforms. (This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

When the vast majority of incumbents are men, as is the case in most national legislatures, incumbency emerges as a male advantage that could hinder the election of women. However, there has been no multi-country - cross-institutional, cross-socioeconomic - study of the relationship between incumbency and women's descriptive representation. Using time-serial data on 33 national legislatures, I examine whether incumbency is a disadvantage for women's election. I find that higher retention rates lead to fewer women winning office after controlling for socioeconomic factors, gender quotas, and electoral rules. Further, term limits, although not designed to promote the election of women, have a positive side effect for women's representation. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {How do elected representatives respond to the needs of immigrant constituents? We report the results of a field experiment on U.S. state legislators in which the nativity, likelihood of voting, and race/ethnicity of a hypothetical constituent are independently manipulated. The experimental design allows us to contribute new insights by isolating the various elements that may impede the connection between immigrants and elected representatives. Moreover, we explore racial/ethnic identities beyond black and white by including Latino and Asian aliases. Contrary to expectations, nativity and voting status do not affect response rates. Instead, legislator behavior appears to be driven by racial/ethnic bias. Whites benefit from the highest response rate, while blacks, Hispanics, and Asians all receive lower rates, respectively. This bias follows a partisan logic. The low response rate for Hispanic constituents comes primarily from Republican legislators, whereas Asians experience bias from representatives of both parties. We argue that this difference may result from Hispanic identity sending a stronger signal about partisan affiliation, or from a prejudicial view of Asians as outsiders. In this last interpretation, rather than the model minority, Asians become the excluded minority.},

Theoretical explanations of educational opportunities suggest that as the pool of job candidates grows quantitatively similar in terms of total educational attainment, qualitative aspects such as college selectivity should have more influence on hiring decisions. This project examines employment opportunities for white and black graduates of elite top-ranked universities vs less selective institutions. I use an experimental audit design to match candidate pairs and apply for 1,008 jobs on a national job search website. The results suggest that higher education credentials do not equalize employment opportunities for blacks compared to whites, even among elite university graduates. Although a credential from an elite university results in more call-backs for all candidates, black candidates from elite universities only do as well as white candidates from less selective universities. Moreover, race results in a double penalty: when employers do respond to black candidates it is for jobs with lower starting salaries than what their white peers receive. * Acknowledgments: This research was supported by a pilot project award fro},

Based on the legal definition, careful studies of loan denial rates, such as that done by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, represent an appropriate method for testing for discrimination by lenders. Based on that study, it is quite clear that lenders discriminate. The fact that minorities have higher default rates on average than whites is irrelevant to the interpretation of the race coefficient in such models. Nonetheless, more research on and discussion about the relationship between the race of the applicant and delinquencies, defaults, and losses would be desirable.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}, Published with license by Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group, LLC. Over the past decade, evidence has accumulated to suggest that bisexual people experience higher rates of poor mental health outcomes compared to both heterosexual and gay/lesbian individuals. However, no previous meta-analyses have been conducted to establish the magnitude of these disparities. To address this research gap, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that reported bisexual-specific data on standardized measures of depression or anxiety. Of the 1,074 full-text articles reviewed, 1,023 were ineligible, predominantly because they did not report separate data for bisexual people (n = 562 studies). Ultimately, 52 eligible studies could be pooled in the analysis. Results indicate that across both outcomes, there is a consistent pattern of lowest rates of depression and anxiety among heterosexual people, while bisexual people exhibit higher or equivalent rates in comparison to lesbian/gay people. On the basis of empirical and theoretical literature, we propose three interrelated contributors to these disparities: experiences of sexual orientation-based discrimination, bisexual invisibility/erasure, and lack of bisexual-affirmative support. Implications for interventions to improve the health and well-being of bisexual people are proposed.},

abstract = {This study examined the effects of minority stress on the physical health of lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals (LGBs). Participants (N = 396) completed baseline and one year follow-up interviews. Exposure to stress and health outcomes were assessed with two methods: a subjective self-appraisal method and a method whereby two independent judges externally rated event narratives using standardized criteria. The odds of experiencing a physical health problem at follow-up were significantly higher among LGBs who experienced an externally rated prejudice event during the follow-up period compared to those who did not.

abstract = {We evaluated how ambitions, community ties, monetary sufficiency, employment, and alcohol consumption related to whether young American Indian adults had moved from their Northern Plains reservation. Of 518 Northern Plains reservation residents in 1993, we located 472 in 2003-2005 and found that 89 lived more than a four-hour drive from the reservation. Coding the 472 as to whether they had stayed on/near the reservation or moved away, we ran logistic regressions on data they reported in 1996 to determine which demographic and attitudinal variables were associated with having moved. We found ambitions and goals were more associated with moving away than were ties to the community, which in turn were more related than monetary and personal characteristics that promote independence and prosperity. The more importance they placed on getting a good education or carrying on the tribe's traditions, the more likely they were to have moved away. We found too that the odds of moving away decreased with greater alcohol consumption. Tribal council members and college administrators therefore may wish to promote policies that increase opportunities for young adults to achieve higher education goals while remaining on reservation to carry on tribal traditions. Benefits may also come from encouraging and assisting reservation members studying off-reservation to return after completing their education. These findings would argue too for greater investment in alcohol services for reservation-dwelling populations.},

@article{Deaton2018,
abstract = {Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are increasingly popular in the social sciences, not only in medicine. We argue that the lay public, and sometimes researchers, put too much trust in RCTs over other methods of investigation. Contrary to frequent claims in the applied literature, randomization does not equalize everything other than the treatment in the treatment and control groups, it does not automatically deliver a precise estimate of the average treatment effect (ATE), and it does not relieve us of the need to think about (observed or unobserved) covariates. Finding out whether an estimate was generated by chance is more difficult than commonly believed. At best, an RCT yields an unbiased estimate, but this property is of limited practical value. Even then, estimates apply only to the sample selected for the trial, often no more than a convenience sample, and justification is required to extend the results to other groups, including any population to which the trial sample belongs, or to any individual, including an individual in the trial. Demanding ‘external validity' is unhelpful because it expects too much of an RCT while undervaluing its potential contribution. RCTs do indeed require minimal assumptions and can operate with little prior knowledge. This is an advantage when persuading distrustful audiences, but it is a disadvantage for cumulative scientific progress, where prior knowledge should be built upon, not discarded. RCTs can play a role in building scientific knowledge and useful predictions but they can only do so as part of a cumulative program, combining with other methods, including conceptual and theoretical development, to discover not ‘what works' but ‘why things work'.},

However, these factors affect the reliability of the regression results only in very limited circumstances. As a result, valid regression analyses do not provide the critical guidance that they should in employment discrimination cases. Our own statistical analyses of seventy-eight Title VII employment discrimination cases find that merely raising these critiques, even if spurious, reduces plaintiffs' likelihood of prevailing at trial. We propose that courts adopt a peer-review system in which court-appointed economists, compensated by each party as a percentage of the total payment to econometric expert witnesses, review econometric evidence before the reports are submitted to the judge or jury.},

We use the 1{\%} sample of longitudinal Social Security administrative data that covers the period from 4 years before to 4 years after the removal of the test. Using a reduced-form quantile regression method, we find that effects on earnings are limited to workers with earnings just around the test threshold and above, as predicted by economic theory. Our estimated effects suggest that labor supply elasticities with respect to the net-of-tax rate are approximately 0.05-0.07 for working primary beneficiaries aged 65-69 whose earnings are between the median and the 80th percentile. Further, results show that applications for Social Security benefits following the earnings test removal accelerated by 2 to 5 percentage points among individuals aged 65-69 and by 3 to 7 percentage points among those reaching age 65. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast, the number of procedures performed in hospitals and total list charges exhibit small but statistically significant discontinuities, implying that patients over 65 receive more services.

The results can therefore be applied broadly, regardless of how sample selection is incurred. Identification instead relies on smoothness conditions. Smoothness conditions are empirically plausible, have readily testable implications, and are typically assumed even in the standard RD design. We first provide identification of the “extensive margin” and “intensive margin” effects. Then based on these identification results and principle stratification, sharp bounds are constructed for the treatment effects among the group of individuals that may be of particular policy interest, that is, those always participating compliers.

The discussion of intersecting discourses is based on empirical material from Poland. It refers to the condition of social policy towards age and gender, in Poland, as well as the media discourse. The results of the study indicate that the intersection between discourses of age and gender involves discriminatory practices that result in an establishment of one-dimensional and pejorative subject positions. Two main subject positions of grandma and pensioner exemplify the main mechanism of a dynamic relationship between both discourses where the order implied by one discourse is strengthened at the expense of the other. The phenomenon of gendered age and aged gender reflects the key rule for understanding subject positions which pertain to categories of older women and older men. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2010.},

Based on similarities between these two versions, we illustrate that much accepted scholarly evidence of policy diffusion could simply have arisen through independent actions by governments that only learn from their own experiences. However, differences between the game-theoretic and decision-theoretic models point the way to future empirical tests that discern learning-based policy diffusion from independent policy adoptions.},

There is a paucity of data regarding sex differences in the assessment and treatment of acute and chronic pain conditions in the ED. The Academic Emergency Medicine consensus conference convened in Dallas, Texas, in May 2014 to develop a research agenda to address this issue among others related to sex differences in the ED. Prior to the conference, experts and stakeholders from emergency medicine and the pain research field reviewed the current literature and identified eight candidate priority areas. At the conference, these eight areas were reviewed and all eight were ratified using a nominal group technique to build consensus. These priority areas were: 1) gender differences in the pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for pain, including differences in opioid tolerance, side effects, or misuse; 2) gender differences in pain severity perceptions, clinically meaningful differences in acute pain, and pain treatment preferences; 3) gender differences in pain outcomes of ED patients across the life span; 4) gender differences in the relationship between acute pain and acute psychological responses; 5) the influence of physician-patient gender differences and characteristics on the assessment and treatment of pain; 6) gender differences in the influence of acute stress and chronic stress on acute pain responses; 7) gender differences in biological mechanisms and molecular pathways mediating acute pain in ED populations; and 8) gender differences in biological mechanisms and molecular pathways mediating chronic pain development after trauma, stress, or acute illness exposure. These areas represent priority areas for future scientific inquiry, and gaining understanding in these will be essential to improving our understanding of sex and gender differences in the assessment and treatment of pain conditions in emergency care settings.},

abstract = {The authors propose a practical way to estimate the effectiveness of state tax incentives. They simulate how much taxpayers'costs are reduced by tax incentives and how those reductions are likely to increase employment. That enables them to address the critical but elusive counterfactual question about the induced rather than gross effects of tax incentives. The importance of this article is not in the elegance of its approach but in its application. The authors demonstrate how a straightforward model can be used to help inform critical decisions that thus far have had little useful input from analysts. Their approach is easily replicable. The simulation results are easy for policy makers to understand. The power of this relatively simple approach has already been demonstrated in North Carolina, where its use is helping to shape tax incentive policy.},

African American patients were significantly more likely to report mistrust. Multivariate analysis found that the perception of racism and mistrust of the medical care system led to less satisfaction with care.

abstract = {Introduction: The decision to treat pain in the emergency department (ED) is a complex, idiosyncratic process. Prior studies have shown that EDs undertreat pain. Several studies demonstrate an association between analgesia administration and race. This is the first Midwest single institution study to address the question of race and analgesia, in addition to examining the effects of both patient and physician characteristics on race-based disparities in analgesia administration. Methods: This was a retrospective chart review of patients presenting to an urban academic ED with an isolated diagnosis of back pain, migraine, or long bone fracture (LBF) from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2011. Demographic and medication administration information was collected from patient charts by trained data collectors blinded to the hypothesis of the study. The primary outcome was the proportion of African-Americans who received analgesia and opiates, as compared to Caucasians, using Pearson's chi-squared test. We developed a multiple logistic regression model to identify which physician and patient characteristics correlated with increased opiate administration. Results: Of the 2,461 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 57{\%} were African-American and 30{\%} Caucasian (n=2136). There was no statistically significant racial difference in the administration of any analgesia (back pain: 86{\%} vs. 86{\%}, p=0.81; migraine: 83{\%} vs. 73{\%}, p=0.09; LBF: 94{\%} vs. 90{\%}, p=0.17), or in opiate administration for migraine or LBF. African-Americans who presented with back pain were less likely to receive an opiate than Caucasians (50{\%} vs. 72{\%}, p{\textless}0.001). Secondary outcomes showed that higher acuity, older age, physician training in emergency medicine, and male physicians were positively associated with opiate administration. Neither race nor gender patient-physician congruency correlated with opiate administration. Conclusion: No race-based disparity in overall analgesia administration was noted for all three conditions: LBF, migraine, and back pain at this institution. A race-based disparity in the likelihood of receiving opiate analgesia for back pain was observed in this ED. The etiology of this is likely multifactorial, but understanding physician and patient characteristics of institutions may help to decrease the disparity by raising awareness of practice patterns and can provide the basis for quality improvement projects.

One limitation that may bias these studies towards finding discrimination is the practice of giving older and younger applicants similar experience in the job to which they are applying, to make them “otherwise comparable.” The second limitation arises because greater unobserved differences in human capital investment of older applicants may bias existing field experiments against finding age discrimination. We also study ages closer to retirement than in past studies, and use a richer set of job profiles for older workers to test for differences associated with transitions to less demanding jobs (“bridge jobs”) at older ages. Based on evidence from over 40,000 job applications, we find robust evidence of age discrimination in hiring against older women. But we find that there is considerably less evidence of age discrimination against men after correcting for the potential biases this study addresses.},

abstract = {In the light of decreased Central Government funding, National Parks and protected areas throughout the world will have to increasingly 'pay for themselves', depending to a greater extent on revenue from tourism, the sale of proceeds and/or external grants. Public preferences and broader economic values are therefore likely to play an increasingly important role in the management of such environmental resources. The purpose of this work was to use an environmental economics framework to estimate public preferences for different habitats within the North York Moors National Park, UK, and the economic value associated with National Parks in the UK. Both heather moorland and semi natural broadleaf woodland were highly valued by visitors to the Park, moorland primarily for recreation and woodland primarily for nature conservation. Contingent valuation revealed that whilst some people thought that increased revenue for the National Park should be raised by the park itself by making more productive use of the land,a significant majority of visitors said they would be prepared to contribute additional revenue towards nature conservation in the National Park. A postal questionnaire revealed that this amounted to a mean value of 3 pounds and 10 pennies per individual per year. This compared with 119 pound per individual per year for all 11 National Parks obtained from an interview questionnaire. The results indicated that most visitors would be willing to provide additional revenue towards nature conservation, and that recreation in the park could therefore be used in a beneficial way to maintain and enhance the parks nature conservation value.},

Respondents were 396 self-identified LGB individuals ages 18-59, recruited from diverse community venues in New York City, with equal numbers of men and women and Whites, Blacks, and Latinos. Respondents were interviewed at baseline and 1-year follow-up. We assessed the relationships among disclosure of sexual orientation, demographic characteristics, health, and minority stress. Rates of nondisclosure to healthcare providers were significantly higher among bisexual men (39.3 {\%}) and bisexual women (32.6 {\%}) compared with gay men (10 {\%}) and lesbians (12.9 {\%}). Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models predicting disclosure of sexual orientation indicated that patient age, level of education, immigration status, medical history, level of internalized homophobia, and degree of connectedness to the LGBT community were significant factors, along with sexual identity. Nondisclosure of sexual orientation was related to poorer psychological well-being at 1 year follow-up. Our findings suggest that interventions targeting sexual minorities ought to carefully tailor messages to subpopulations. In particular, interventionists and clinicians ought to be mindful of differences between bisexually and gay/lesbian-identified individuals. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

We propose a model-free approach for testing for the presence of such unexplained variation. To use this randomization-based approach, we must address the fact that the average treatment effect, which is generally the object of interest in randomized experiments, actually acts as a nuisance parameter in this setting. We explore potential solutions and advocate for a method that guarantees valid tests in finite samples despite this nuisance. We also show how this method readily extends to testing for heterogeneity beyond a given model, which can be useful for assessing the sufficiency of a given scientific theory. We finally apply our method to the National Head Start impact study, which is a large-scale randomized evaluation of a Federal preschool programme, finding that there is indeed significant unexplained treatment effect variation.},

abstract = {Objectives. We examined cross-national differences in perceptions of age discrimination in England and the United States. Under the premise that the United States has had age discrimination legislation in place for considerably longer than England, we hypothesized that perceptions of age discrimination would be lower in the United States. Methods. We analyzed data from two nationally representative studies of aging, the U.S. Health and Retirement Study (n = 4,818) and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (n = 7,478). Respondents aged 52 years and older who attributed any experiences of discrimination to their age were treated as cases of perceived age discrimination. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the odds ratios of experiencing perceived age discrimination in relation to selected sociodemographic factors. Results. Perceptions of age discrimination were significantly higher in England than the United States, with 34.8{\%} of men and women in England reporting age discrimination compared with 29.1{\%} in the United States. Associations between perceived age discrimination and older age and lower levels of household wealth were observed in both countries, but we found differences between England and the United States in the relationship between perceived age discrimination and education. Discussion. Our study revealed that levels of perceived age discrimination are lower in the United States than England and are less socially patterned. This suggests that differing social and political circumstances in the two countries may have an important role to play.},

Based on the legal definition, careful studies of loan denial rates, such as that done by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, represent an appropriate method for testing for discrimination by lenders. Based on that study, it is quite clear that lenders discriminate. The fact that minorities have higher default rates on average than whites is irrelevant to the interpretation of the race coefficient in such models. Nonetheless, more research on and discussion about the relationship between the race of the applicant and delinquencies, defaults, and losses would be desirable.},

We hypothesized that the therapeutic relationship would mediate the relation between clients' perceptions of their therapists' affirmative practices and psychological well-being while controlling for precounseling distress, client age, client race/ethnicity, number of psychotherapy sessions, and therapist gender. A nationwide sample of 184 LGBQ individuals was recruited through the Internet. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 64 years old (Mage = 27.57; SD = 8.50), and the majority identified as female (65.8{\%}) and White (77.2{\%}). Structural equation modeling showed that participants' perceptions of their therapists' affirmative practices were associated with psychological well-being ($\beta$ = .21, p {\textless} .01). Findings also indicated that the therapeutic relationship mediated the association between clients' perceptions of therapists' affirmative practices and psychological well-being ($\beta$=.34, p {\textless} .001, 95{\%} confidence interval [.15, .52]).

Methods: Data were collected from 2007 to 2008 as part of a larger community-based survey in the greater Chicago area. Scales measured discrimination, acculturation, and substance use. Structural equation modeling validated scales and examined their relationships, which were further described via mediation analysis. Results: Increased acculturation leads to substance use and this relationship is partially mediated by discrimination (Sobel test = 2.10; p {\textless} .05).

abstract = {This paper seeks to determine the underlying causes behind the “runaway film phenomenon”: the mass migration of American feature filmmaking to Canada, particularly British Columbia, which has resulted in the loss of millions of dollars and thousands of motion picture production jobs in the Los Angeles area. Four possible causes are examined: the US/Canada exchange rate; rebates paid by the Canadian national and provincial governments to producers who hire Canadian motion picture production workers; demarcation rules present in the Hollywood production workers' contract; and the escalation of actors' salary demands, which forces producers to cut costs in other areas of filmmaking. Regression and maximum likelihood analyses are used to determine the magnitude of each of these four possible causes on the ratio of runaway to non-runaway films over the time period 1977-2000. The author finds that the demarcation rules, which are accentuated by the rebates and exchange rate, are a driving force behind runaway production. Actors' salaries are also found to promote runaway filming, although to a less determined extent due to data insufficiency.},

Using a random utility framework, I estimate that women are willing to choose a college in the bottom half of the quality distribution over a college in the top quintile for a route that is perceived to be one standard deviation (SD) safer. Alternatively, women are willing to spend an additional INR 18,800 (USD 290) per year, relative to men, for a route that is one SD safer – an amount equal to double the average annual college tuition.

abstract = {The Family Options Study: Three-year Impacts of Housing and Services Interventions for Homeless Families documents the outcomes of the 2,282 formerly homeless study families approximately 37 months after having been randomly assigned to one of four housing and/or services interventions. The findings at 37-months in large part mirror the findings documented at 20 months, with the long-terms outcomes again demonstrating the power of a voucher to convey significantly improved housing outcomes to formerly homeless families, when compared with the housing outcomes of families offered other interventions. Families offered a permanent subsidy experienced less than half as many episodes of subsequent homelessness, and vast improvements across a broad set of measures related to residential stability. Many of the non-housing outcomes of interest that were strongly influenced by the offer of a voucher in the short-term, such as reductions in psychological distress and intimate partner violence, are still detected, but some positive impacts found at the 20-month followup are not detected at the longer, 37-month followup. For example, 20 months after random assignment, assignment to SUB reduced the proportion of families with child separations in the 6 months before the survey--this effect was not detected in the 6 months before the 37-month survey. Also in this longer window of observation, some positive impacts in the child well-being domain have emerged. Families offered a voucher continue to be significantly more food secure and experience significantly less economic stress than families offered the other interventions. On measures of employment and earnings, the modest negative impacts of vouchers relative to usual care have fallen, although some remain statistically significant.},

abstract = {We develop tools for utilizing correspondence experiments to detect illegal discrimination by individual employers. Employers violate US employment law if their propensity to contact applicants depends on protected characteristics such as race or sex. We establish identification of higher moments of the causal effects of protected characteristics on callback rates as a function of the number of fictitious applications sent to each job ad. These moments are used to bound the fraction of jobs that illegally discriminate. Applying our results to three experimental datasets, we find evidence of significant employer heterogeneity in discriminatory behavior, with the standard deviation of gaps in job-specific callback probabilities across protected groups averaging roughly twice the mean gap. In a recent experiment manipulating racially distinctive names, we estimate that at least 85{\%} of jobs that contact both of two white applications and neither of two black applications are engaged in illegal discrimination. To assess the tradeoff between type I and II errors presented by these patterns, we consider the performance of a series of decision rules for investigating suspicious callback behavior under a simple two-type model that rationalizes the experimental data. Though, in our preferred specification, only 17{\%} of employers are estimated to discriminate on the basis of race, we find that an experiment sending 10 applications to each job would enable accurate detection of 7-10{\%} of discriminators while falsely accusing fewer than 0.2{\%} of non-discriminators. A minimax decision rule acknowledging partial identification of the joint distribution of callback rates yields higher error rates but more investigations than our baseline two-type model. Our results suggest illegal labor market discrimination can be reliably monitored with relatively small modifications to existing audit designs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Implicit biases involve associations outside conscious awareness that lead to a negative evaluation of a person on the basis of irrelevant characteristics such as race or gender. This review examines the evidence that healthcare professionals display implicit biases towards patients. METHODS PubMed, PsychINFO, PsychARTICLE and CINAHL were searched for peer-reviewed articles published between 1st March 2003 and 31st March 2013. Two reviewers assessed the eligibility of the identified papers based on precise content and quality criteria. The references of eligible papers were examined to identify further eligible studies. RESULTS Forty two articles were identified as eligible. Seventeen used an implicit measure (Implicit Association Test in fifteen and subliminal priming in two), to test the biases of healthcare professionals. Twenty five articles employed a between-subjects design, using vignettes to examine the influence of patient characteristics on healthcare professionals' attitudes, diagnoses, and treatment decisions. The second method was included although it does not isolate implicit attitudes because it is recognised by psychologists who specialise in implicit cognition as a way of detecting the possible presence of implicit bias. Twenty seven studies examined racial/ethnic biases; ten other biases were investigated, including gender, age and weight. Thirty five articles found evidence of implicit bias in healthcare professionals; all the studies that investigated correlations found a significant positive relationship between level of implicit bias and lower quality of care. DISCUSSION The evidence indicates that healthcare professionals exhibit the same levels of implicit bias as the wider population. The interactions between multiple patient characteristics and between healthcare professional and patient characteristics reveal the complexity of the phenomenon of implicit bias and its influence on clinician-patient interaction. The most convincing studies from our review are those that combine the IAT and a method measuring the quality of treatment in the actual world. Correlational evidence indicates that biases are likely to influence diagnosis and treatment decisions and levels of care in some circumstances and need to be further investigated. Our review also indicates that there may sometimes be a gap between the norm of impartiality and the extent to which it is embraced by healthcare professionals for some of the tested characteristics. CONCLUSIONS Our findings highlight the need for the healthcare profession to address the role of implicit biases in disparities in healthcare.

We also find a discrete 9 percent increase in the mortality rate at age 21, primarily due to motor vehicle accidents, alcohol-related deaths, and suicides. We estimate a 10 percent increase in the number of drinking days for young adults results in a 4.3 percent increase in mortality. Our results suggest policies that reduce drinking among young adults can have substantial public health benefits. (JEL I12, I18).},

We randomly allocate caste-linked surnames across resumes in order to isolate the effect of caste on applicants' job-search outcomes. We find no evidence of discrimination against non-upper-caste (i.e. Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, and Other Backward Caste) applicants for software jobs. We do find large and significant differences between callback rates for upper-castes and Other Backward Castes (and to a lesser extent Scheduled Castes) in the case of call-center jobs. There is no evidence of discrimination against Muslims for either of the two kinds of jobs we apply for. Overall, the evidence suggests that applicants' caste identities do not significantly affect the callback decisions of firms.

This multi-cutoff regression discontinuity design is very common in empirical work, and researchers often normalize the score variable and use the zero cutoff on the normalized score for all observations to estimate a pooled RD treatment effect. We formally derive the form that this pooled parameter takes and discuss its interpretation under different assumptions. We show that this normalizing-and-pooling strategy so commonly employed in practice may not fully exploit all the information available in a multi-cutoff RD setup. We illustrate our methodological results with three empirical examples based on vote shares, population, and test scores.},

abstract = {We propose a method to assess the sensitivity of econometric analyses to the removal of a small fraction of the sample. Analyzing all possible data subsets of a certain size is computationally prohibitive, so we provide a finite-sample metric to approximately compute the number (or fraction) of observations that has the greatest influence on a given result when dropped. We call our resulting metric the Approximate Maximum Influence Perturbation. Our approximation is automatically computable and works for common estimators (including OLS, IV, GMM, MLE, and variational Bayes). We provide explicit finite-sample error bounds on our approximation for linear and instrumental variables regressions. At minimal computational cost, our metric provides an exact finite-sample lower bound on sensitivity for any estimator, so any non-robustness our metric finds is conclusive. We demonstrate that the Approximate Maximum Influence Perturbation is driven by a low signal-to-noise ratio in the inference problem, is not reflected in standard errors, does not disappear asymptotically, and is not a product of misspecification. Several empirical applications show that even 2-parameter linear regression analyses of randomized trials can be highly sensitive. While we find some applications are robust, in others the sign of a treatment effect can be changed by dropping less than 1{\%} of the sample even when standard errors are small.},

Using a thematic content analysis informed by grounded theory (Glaser {\&} Strauss, 1967), participants' responses were coded into 4 main domains: (a) interpersonal issues, (b) intrapersonal factors, (c) systemic and organizational issues, and (d) logistics and planning. Each of these domains was comprised of thematic categories and subcategories that further elucidated participants' experiences related to these domains. Findings highlighted key areas of stress (e.g., hostile coworkers, gendered spaces, no employee protection policies) and strategies for preparing to transition genders at work (e.g., informing human resources, identifying allies). Implications of these results for practitioners, employers, and activists are discussed.},

Based upon focus group interviews, our empirical analysis focuses on key dimensions of participants' identity practice and how they sought to manage the following social processes: imposed identities; crafting working identities; and contesting unfavourable working identities.The conclusion contextualizes the findings against a backdrop of increasing individualistic discourses underpinning approaches to employability, closes with the policy implications arising from this study, and makes suggestions for future research agendas.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Patients' gender remains a contributor for bias in pain management. Implementation of standardised analgesic protocols has been shown to minimise bias in analgesic care. The purpose of this study was to assess whether gender-related bias in pain management exists in our emergency department (ED) setting, where a standardised pain management protocol based on patients' subjective pain rating is routinely used. METHODS Pain management measures (ie, analgesia administration, waiting time for analgesia, pain relief and patients' satisfaction) were prospectively assessed in 328 patients (150 women and 178 men, average age 36±18 years) who were treated in our ED for acute musculoskeletal pain. RESULTS Patients' subjective pain rating on arrival were similar for men and women (59±24 mm vs 61±26 mm, respectively; p=0.47). Interestingly, physicians using the same scale assessed the women's pain level to be higher than that of men (75±25 mm vs 63±22 mm, respectively; p{\textless}0.001) and higher than that of women's subjective pain rating (75±25 mm vs 61±26 mm respectively; p{\textless}0.001). Nevertheless, the rates of analgesia administration, waiting time for analgesia, pain relief and patient satisfaction were similar for both genders. Physicians' own gender did not affect analgesic care. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that a standardised pain management protocol based on patients' subjective pain rating may reduce gender-related bias in acute musculoskeletal pain management.},

These applicants were given equivalent r{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}}s and sent to apply in tandem for hundreds of entry-level jobs. Our results show that black applicants were half as likely as equally qualified whites to receive a callback or job offer. In fact, black and Latino applicants with clean backgrounds fared no better than white applicants just released from prison. Additional qualitative evidence from our applicants' experiences further illustrates the multiple points at which employment trajectories can be deflected by various forms of racial bias. These results point to the subtle yet systematic forms of discrimination that continue to shape employment opportunities for low-wage workers.},

In 2005, six movies filmed in New Orleans, which created over 600 new jobs.2 However, Hollywood's perceived altruism may be somewhat misplaced. While it is commendable that recent film production created 600 new jobs in New Orleans, it is naive to think that the film industry's presence in New Orleans is entirely altruistic. In 2005, before Hurricane Katrina, movies filmed in Louisiana had a combined budget of {\$}550 million.4 Filming in Louisiana is not about altruism; it is about economics.},

Controlling for demographic, income, wealth, employment, and housing characteristics, we find no significant differences between whites and Asians, Mexicans, or Cubans. Conversely, blacks and Puerto Ricans remain substantially disadvantaged. We conduct further analysis for the 2001-2003, 2004-2007, and 2008-2010 periods of the housing boom and collapse. Blacks and Puerto Ricans experienced decreased disparities during the peak years of the boom. Puerto Rican parity with whites continued to improve during the crash while gains among blacks eroded. The results suggest the homeownership differences between whites, Asians, Mexicans, and Cubans are apparently explained by socioeconomic status while racial disparities among blacks and Puerto Ricans evolved but continue to persist. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Following a terrorist attack on the main Jewish center in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in July 1994, all Jewish institutions received police protection. Thus, this hideous event induced a geographical allocation of police forces that can be presumed exogenous in a crime regression. Using data on the location of car thefts before and after the attack, we find a large deterrent effect of observable police on crime. The effect is local, with no appreciable impact outside the narrow area in which the police are deployed. (JEL},

Objective: This critical review aims to integrate the literature on stigma towards transgender people in the US. Results: This review demonstrates that transgender stigma limits opportunities and access to resources in a number of critical domains (e.g., employment, healthcare), persistently affecting the physical and mental health of transgender people. The applied social ecological model employed here elucidates that transgender stigma operates at multiple levels (i.e., individual, interpersonal, structural) to impact health. Stigma prevention and coping interventions hold promise for reducing stigma and its adverse health-related effects in transgender populations. Conclusion: Additional research is needed to document the causal relationship between stigma and adverse health as well as the mediators and moderators of stigma in US transgender populations. Multi-level interventions to prevent stigma towards transgender people are warranted.},

@article{bartik1989,
abstract = {This paper estimates how the characteristics of American states affect small business start-ups. The paper is of interest for three reasons: two methodological contributions; and, the paper's empirical findings. First, unlike most of the business location literature, the paper relies on micro data. The availability of micro data allows a focus on one specific type of business location decision, the small business start decision. Most previous business location research has used an aggregate business activity measure as the dependent variable. Examining one type of business location decision allows the use of a micro model of profit-maximization. Aggregate measures of local economic activity reflect small business start-ups, new branch plants, plant expansions and contractions, and plant closings. These decisions probably are made in very different ways. These differences make it difficult to devise an aggregate model of business location. This study shows that panel data analysis of small business starts can yield more economically sensible results than cross-section analysis. Small business starts in a state primarily depend on entrepreneurial opportunities offered by high market demand relative to industry supply. State tax cuts have a positive but modestly-sized effect on small business starts. If the tax cut requires a reduction in business-related public services, small business starts will be reduced. Finally, small business starts are encouraged by greater competitiveness of state financial markets.

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether there is unequal treatment in hiring depending on whether a job applicant signals living in a bad (deprived) neighborhood or in a good (affluent) neighborhood. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a field experiment where fictitious job applications were sent to employers with an advertised vacancy. Each job application was randomly assigned a residential address in either a bad or a good neighborhood. The measured outcome is the fraction of invitations for a job interview (the callback rate). Findings: The authors find no evidence of general neighborhood signaling effects. However, job applicants with a foreign background have callback rates that are 42 percent lower if they signal living in a bad neighborhood rather than in a good neighborhood. In addition, the authors find that applicants with commuting times longer than 90 minutes have lower callback rates, and this is unrelated to the neighborhood signaling effect. Originality/value: Empirical evidence of causal neighborhood effects on labor market outcomes is scant, and causal evidence on the mechanisms involved is even more scant. The paper provides such evidence.},

In light of renewed interest in field experimental methods, this review covers a wide range of field experiments from across the social sciences, with an eye to those that adopt virtuous practices, including unobtrusive measurement, naturalistic interventions, attention to realistic outcomes and consequential behaviors, and application to diverse samples and settings. The review covers four broad research areas of substantive and policy interest: first, randomized controlled trials, with a focus on policy interventions in economic development, poverty reduction, and education; second, experiments on the role that norms, motivations, and incentives play in shaping behavior; third, experiments on political mobilization, social influence, and institutional effects; and fourth, experiments on prejudice and discrimination. We discuss methodological issues concerning generalizability and scalability as well as ethical issues related to field experimental methods. We conclude by arguing that field experiments are well equipped to advance the kind of middle-range theorizing that sociologists value.},

abstract = {This study examined whether economic changes related to the 2008–2009 Recession were associated with employment status and job quality indicators among older workers in Europe and Israel. Data were derived from 4917 respondents (16,090 observations both before and after the recession) from 13 countries who participated in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe. Annual data on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, life expectancy, and quarterly unemployment rates were assigned to employment assessments from 2004 to 2013. Using difference-in-differences models, we assessed the recession's implications on individual employment outcomes, while isolating cyclical variation within countries and individual changes over time. Among older workers, decreases in GDP were associated with an increase in the likelihood of being unemployed and a decrease in the likelihood of being retired. An increasing country-level unemployment rate had a significant effect on aspects of job quality: lower prospects for job advancement, lower job security, and higher job satisfaction. Economic recessions are thus negatively associated with employment outcomes for older workers. However, malleable policy-related factors such as longer tenure and improved general health can limit the negative employment and job quality outcomes following a recession.},

Poor performance by older subordinates was attributed more to stable factors than similar performance by younger subordinates. In addition, job simplification was rated as more appropriate and training was recommended as less appropriate for older subordinates.

In this paper, we examine the increasing number of land-use regulations in Greater Boston. These regulations vary widely over space, and are hard to predict with any variables other than historical density levels. Minimum lot size and other land use controls are associated with reductions in new construction activity. These regulations are associated with higher prices when we do not control for contemporary density and demographics, but not when we add these contemporaneous controls. These results are compatible with economic theory, which predicts that production restraints on a good won't increase the price of that good relative to sufficiently close substitutes. Current density levels appear to be too low to maximize local land values. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The data for this article are drawn from a data set of attendance at more than nine hundred social networking events over a six-year period in New York City's Internet, or "new media," industry. These data confirm that place became more, not less, important to cultural production over this period. Networking, or the processes of the formation of social network ties, is concentrated in activities within narrow geographic clusters. This study suggests that the networking events within the industry-cocktail parties, seminars, ceremonies, and the like-mediate access to crucial resources within the industry.},

abstract = {Introduction: As concerns grow that a thinning labor force due to retirement will lead to worker shortages, it becomes critical to support positive employment outcomes of groups who have been underutilized, specifically older workers and workers with disabilities. Better understanding perceived age and disability discrimination and their intersection can help rehabilitation specialists and employers address challenges expected as a result of the evolving workforce. Methods: Using U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Integrated Mission System data, we investigate the nature of employment discrimination charges that cite the Americans with Disabilities Act or Age Discrimination in Employment Act individually or jointly. We focus on trends in joint filings over time and across categories of age, types of disabilities, and alleged discriminatory behavior. Results: We find that employment discrimination claims that originate from older or disabled workers are concentrated within a subset of issues that include reasonable accommodation, retaliation, and termination. Age-related disabilities are more frequently referenced in joint cases than in the overall pool of ADA filings, while the psychiatric disorders are less often referenced in joint cases. When examining charges made by those protected under both the ADA and ADEA, results from a logit model indicate that in comparison to charges filed under the ADA alone, jointly-filed ADA/ADEA charges are more likely to be filed by older individuals, by those who perceive discrimination in hiring and termination, and to originate from within the smallest firms. Conclusion: In light of these findings, rehabilitation and workplace practices to maximize the hiring and retention of older workers and those with disabilities are discussed.

We adopt a randomized correspondence audit design by sending inquiry emails to randomly selected property owners or agents from Craigslist. The signals are conveyed by names, body text, and signature-line quotations. The findings suggest landlords have preferences about tenants and make decisions based on signals communicated in inquiry emails from potential applicants. Blacks, Arab males, Muslims, and single parents are treated unfavorably while gay couples are preferred. These discrimination patterns are generally consistent with the theory of agent-based statistical discrimination. The results provide evidence that many groups protected under U.S. fair housing law continue to face obstacles when searching for housing despite decades of fair housing law.},

@book{Kingdon1984,
abstract = {Kingdon addresses the dominant approaches to describing policy change and proposes an alternative, a modified version of the "Garbage Can" approach proposed by Cohen, March, and Olsen. In this approach, government is an "organized anarchy" with three families of processes related to agenda setting: problems, policies, and politics. Actors can be involved in one or several streams at the same time. There are also three major process streams: problem recognition, the formation and refining of policy proposals, and politics. The three process streams are largely independent, but when seperate streams come together (a problem is recognized, a solution is available, the political climate is affable, and constraints are limited) we see significant policy change (i.e. the garbage can). This theory is put in contrast to comprehensive rational decision making (most notably critiqued by Lindblohm) and incrementalism. Though Kingdon sees a place for incrementalism as descriptive, he argues that it doesn't describe big policy change very well, only the incremental maintenance of preexisting policies.},

abstract = {When employers conduct more internal hiring, does this facilitate upward mobility for low-paid workers or does it protect the already advantaged? To assess the effect of within-employer job mobility on occupational stratification, we develop a framework that accounts for inequality in both rates and payoffs of job changing. Internal hiring facilitates advancement for workers without strong credentials, but it excludes workers at employers with few good jobs to advance into. Analyzing Current Population Survey data, we find that when internal hiring increases in a local labor market, it facilitates upward mobility less than when external hiring increases. When workers in low-paid occupations switch jobs, they benefit more from switching employers than from moving jobs within the same employer. One-third of this difference is due to low-paid workers isolated in industries with few high-paying jobs to transfer into. An occupationally segregated labor market therefore limits the benefits that internal hiring can bring to the workers who most need upward mobility.},

Although dependency on percent black as the main indicator of racial threat in many studies has contributed to the inconsistency in findings, we argue that this literature has also neglected to consider other important conceptual and methodological issues. Using 2000 census and arrest data, we estimate the impact of multiple measures of racial economic threat, such as the size of the black population, racial inequality and black immigration patterns on black arrest rates. Furthermore, by integrating racial competition and race-relations arguments, we examine how the concentration of black disadvantage may temper the extent to which blacks pose a threat to white interests. Our findings reveal important and conceptually distinct relationships between racial threat, concentrated disadvantage and the use of social control against blacks, particularly when compared to white arrests.},

In 1984, more than one-half of the offer wage differential between disabled and nondisabied women is attributable to discrimination, but the absolute wage differential is small. The results suggest that wage discrimination related to disability tends to be most severe for a relatively small group of women with impairments against which prejudice is most intense. There is a large difference between the employment rates of disabled and nondisabied women but only a small part of the differential is attributable to the disincentive effects of wage discrimination. The results also show that women with disabilities face a double burden of gender- and disability-related discrimination, but do not show that gender-related discrimination is worse for women who have a disability.},

We investigated sex (patient and provider) differences in pain treatment and the extent to which providers' sexist attitudes were associated with these differences. Ninety-eight health care providers (52{\%} female) completed the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory and made treatment ratings for 16 computer-simulated patients with low back pain. Patient sex was balanced across vignettes. Results indicated that female patients received significantly higher antidepressant (F[1, 96] = 4.51, P {\textless}.05, $\eta$p2 =.05) and mental health referral (F[1, 96] = 3.89, P =.05, $\eta$p2 =.04) ratings than male patients, which is consistent with our hypotheses; however, these differences were significant only among female providers. Controlling for providers' sexism scores did not substantially alter these results, which is counter to our hypotheses. These results suggest that female providers are more likely to recommend psychosocial treatments for female than for male pain patients, and providers' sexist attitudes do not account for these differences. Research is needed to elucidate the contributors to sex/gender differences in treatment in order to reduce pain disparities. Perspective The results of this study suggest that patient and provider sex, but not providers' sexist attitudes, influence pain care. These findings may inform efforts to raise awareness of sex/gender differences in pain care and reduce disparities. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the American Pain Society.},

We also find that referrals performed particularly well when working directly with their referrers. However, we do not find evidence that referrals exert more effort because they believe their performance will affect their relationship with their referrer or their referrer's position at the firm.},

abstract = {Stigma and discrimination related to sexual minority status are unique stressors associated with mental and physical health concerns among sexual minority individuals. Although some theoretical models propose that the strategies sexual minorities apply to cope with these particular stressors can mediate and/or moderate their impact on mental health outcomes, only a few studies have examined this proposition empirically, typically using measures of broad coping strategies that are not discrimination- specific. A nonprobability sample of 354 self-identified lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals completed self-report measures of perceived discrimination experiences, psychological distress, and discrimination-specific coping strategies used, including education/advocacy, internalization, drug and alcohol use, resistance, and detachment strategies. Perceived discrimination explained levels of depres- sion, anxiety, and stress after controlling for income, education, and race. Drug and alcohol use mediated the relationship between discrimination and depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Internalization mediated the relationship between discrimination and anxiety symptoms and moderated the relationship between discrimination and depression and anxiety. The education/advocacy, resistance, and detachment strategies played no clear mediator or moderator roles in the relationship between discrimination and psychological distress. Psychological interventions that assist sexual minority clients in the development of effective coping skills, such as avoidance of drug and alcohol use for coping and internalization may reduce the harm associated with the experience of stigma and discrimination.},

abstract = {Evidence from industry reports, labor union data, and interviews with producers and union officials indicates that while the demand for media products and the number of productions continues to rise, much of the increase in demand is in low-budget features and extremely low-budget production for cable networks. In this production environment, the conglomerates are pressuring producers to reduce labor costs and produce a larger number of low-cost products. Producers are using various strategies to reduce costs, including requiring more flexibility from the production workforce with respect to the length of workdays and working conditions. This article examines how production trends, influenced by conglomerate domination of production and distribution, are affecting the media workforce. In particular I look at three tendencies. The first is a widening split between core workers and peripheral workers employed in industry projects. The second is a change in professional and craft identities as a result of technological specialization by freelancers and the loss of union control over production projects, especially at the low end of the budget spectrum. Finally, there is the persistence of `hard-wired' social and economic networks to reduce worker and employer risk. These networks foster and reinforce labor segmentation among women and men, and among ethnic groups, restricting access to job opportunities and careers.},

Biases are complex but systematic, differing by racial/ethnic group and not limited to love-hate polarities. Group images on the universal social cognitive dimensions of competence and warmth determine the content of each group's overall stereotype, distinct emotional prejudices (pity, envy, disgust, pride), and discriminatory tendencies. These biases are often unconscious and occur despite the best intentions. Such ambivalent and automatic biases can influence medical decisions and interactions, systematically producing discrimination in health care and ultimately disparities in health. Understanding how these processes may contribute to bias in health care can help guide interventions to address racial and ethnic disparities in health.},

Seven transgendered participants who had lived full-time as their non-natal gender for at least three months and who had spent at least the majority of a course of therapy discussing their current gender identity were recruited. Interviews were semi-structured, and each was transcribed verbatim. Three levels of coding were used for analysis: seven individual depictions in narrative form, a single composite depiction bringing together similarities between the experiences of the participants, and a single exemplary depiction of critical themes. Results suggest that the participants did not experience many of the heterosexist, sexist, and pathologizing biases described in previous studies. Rather they described supportive and affirming relationships with their therapists. Some participants had had negative experiences with previous therapists. Participants called for further training and education for therapists and other helping professionals. Implications for theory, research, practice, and policy are explored. [},

Emerging research shows that implicit bias is prevalent among service providers. These negative or stigmatizing attitudes toward population groups are held at a subconscious level and are automatically activated during practitioner-client encounters. The authors provide examples of how implicit bias may impede access to care, clinical screening and diagnosis, treatment processes, and crisis response. They also discuss how implicit attitudes may manifest at the intersection between mental health and criminal justice institutions. Finally, they discuss the need for more research on the impact of implicit bias on health practices throughout the mental health system, including the development of interventions to address implicit bias among mental health professionals.},

abstract = {The article explores the possible short-term effects of the financial crisis in Norway on cognitive, affective, and behavioral components of managers' attitudes to older workers. The quick shifts in business cycles in 2008 and 2009, i.e., the financial crisis, produced some immediate reactions among managers. In particular, the protection of older workers by downsizing (the seniority principle) gained less support within the first half year of the crisis; however, there was a return to the former level of support within the next half year. This pattern of change was observed in the private sector, while managers in the public sector changed attitudes on a smaller scale and in the direction of increased support for the seniority principle. The data are from the Norwegian Senior Policy Barometer where national samples of managers in private companies and in the public sector are interviewed. The study has a time series design with new samples (N=750) each year from 2003 to 2011. The cognitive component of attitudes was less affected by the financial crisis than the behavioral disposition mentioned above. The tendency was for more positive conceptions of older workers among managers in the public sector. In the private sector, the views of managers changed even less and in the opposite direction. An impact of more gradual business cycles is seen in the affective component of attitudes. Yet, older workers are among the least popular categories to recruit in both rising and falling cycles. The finding that managers in the private sector are more affected than managers in the less market-exposed public sector supports the possible effects of the financial crisis on attitudes to older workers. For senior policy, it is notable to keep track of long-term trends and not to be beset by short-term shifts in the need for older workers. Lasting effects of falling business cycles on the employment of older workers may be prevented by reinforcing a solid basis of realistic cognitions about older workers and by openness concerning affective aspects of aging and older workers.},

abstract = {The history of the development of statistical hypothesis testing in time series analysis is reviewed briefly and it is pointed out that the hypothesis testing procedure is not adequately defined as the procedure for statistical model identification. The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.},

abstract = {The Civil Rights Act of 1991 (CRA91) was enacted after a rancorous debate about whether it was a "quota" hiring bill or a necessary means of opening labor markets. In this paper, we analyze the effects of CRA91 on the composition of firms' workforces. We consider employer behavior when firms vary exogenously in their susceptibility to discrimination suits and when firms can reduce their exposure to discrimination claims by employing more protected workers. These forces lead to a sorting effect, which causes firms that are more susceptible to discrimination litigation to substitute away from protected workers, and a quota effect, which causes firms with fewer pre-CRA91 protected workers to substitute toward these workers. We examine these effects empirically using data collected from a variety of sources. We find that trends in employment shares of protected workers changed after CRA91 in a manner consistent with the sorting effect. Whereas prior to CRA91 employment of blacks and women had been increasing in industries where they had been least represented, this trend did not continue into the post-CRA91 period. We find no evidence that CRA91 lead to widespread quota hiring and no evidence that CRA91 helped integrate industries that excluded protected workers.},

This paper reports a regression analysis of employment growth in 37 disaggregated sectors across U.S. metropolitan areas in the time period 1977–1984. The results indicate that variation in taxes and subsidies are not related significantly to the location of either high-technology manufacturing or most services. Our results suggest, however, that enterprise zones and university research parks, which may be proxies for focused economic development programs, are associated with increased job growth. Nevertheless the strongest determinants of growth are localization and urbanization externalities, along with labor costs and skill factors. We hypothesize that localization economies operate through the reduction of information costs, especially those associated with firms' search behaviors for skilled labor forces.},

The magnitude of this impact provides a rare opportunity to (a) estimate local average treatment effects (LATE) of high school that come close to population average treatment effects (ATE); and (b) estimate returns to education using a regression discontinuity design instead of previous estimates that rely on difference-in-differences methodology or relatively weak instruments. Comparing LATE estimates for the United States and Canada, where very few students were affected by compulsory school laws, to the United Kingdom estimates provides a test as to whether instrumental variables (IV) returns to schooling often exceed ordinary least squares (OLS) because gains are high only for small and peculiar groups among the more general population. I find, instead, that the benefits from compulsory schooling are very large whether these laws have an impact on a majority or minority of those exposed.},

Farmers and small business owners frequently complain that the estate tax makes it difficult to pass their operations on to their heirs. If there are insufficient liquid assets in the entrepreneur's estate, the heirs may be forced to sell the enterprise in order to pay the estate tax. Using variation in tax liability from state and federal tax changes in 1982, I estimate the effect of the estate tax on business sales. Estimates from models using cross-year tax variation and a difference-in-difference strategy provide some evidence for a positive effect of the estate tax on sales, although it is difficult to link this to explicit measures of liquidity need. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

By following a sample of black and white renters over time, we are able to separately study racial differences in the likelihood of applying for a mortgage and in the likelihood that a mortgage application is accepted. Although its effect on the race gap in housing transitions is small, we find strong evidence that black applicants are almost twice as likely as comparable white households to be rejected, even when credit history proxies and measures of household wealth are accounted for. We show that the housing transition gap exists primarily because blacks are less likely to apply for mortgages in the first place. The analysis suggests that differences in income, family structure, and in the ability and willingness of parents to provide down-payment assistance are the primary reasons for this applications gap. We speculate that the portion of the gap that remains unexplained after controlling for income, demographics, and wealth may be the result of blacks anticipating a greater chance of rejection when they apply for mortgages.},

These dramatic differences in the cyclicality across demographic groups are remarkably stable across three decades of time and throughout recessionary periods and expansionary periods.

abstract = {Background Providing increases in Medicaid reimbursements for primary care, a key provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), raised Medicaid payments to Medicare levels in 2013 and 2014 for selected services and providers. The federally funded increase in reimbursements was aimed at expanding access to primary care for the growing number of Medicaid enrollees. The reimbursement increase expired at the end of 2014 in most states before policymakers had much empirical evidence about its effects. Methods We measured the availability of and waiting times for appointments in 10 states dincuring two periods: from November 2012 through March 2013 and from May 2014 through July 2014. Trained field staff posed as either Medicaid enrollees or privately insured enrollees seeking new-patient primary care appointments. We estimated state-level changes over time in a stable cohort of primary care practices that participated in Medicaid to assess whether willingness to provide appointments for new Medicaid enrollees was related to the size of increases in Medicaid reimbursements in each state. Results The availability of primary care appointments in the Medicaid group increased by 7.7 percentage points, from 58.7{\%} to 66.4{\%}, between the two time periods. The states with the largest increases in availability tended to be those with the largest increases in reimbursements, with an estimated increase of 1.25 percentage points in availability per 10{\%} increase in Medicaid reimbursements (P=0.03). No such association was observed in the private-insurance group. During the same periods, waiting times to a scheduled new-patient appointment remained stable over time in the two study groups. Conclusions Our study provides early evidence that increased Medicaid reimbursement to primary care providers, as mandated in the ACA, was associated with improved appointment availability for Medicaid enrollees among participating providers without generating longer waiting times.

We perform a meta-analysis of correspondence tests from 25 separate studies conducted in OECD countries between 2006 and 2017, containing more than 300 estimates of effects and representing a total of more than 110,000 e-mails sent to private landlords or real-estate agents. In addition to presenting overall results of recent studies, we focus on subgroups of specific correspondence tests in order to highlight the differences in ethnicity, gender, type of landlords, procedure, continent, and type of information provided in applications. We provide evidence that both gender and ethnic discrimination occur in the rental housing market in OECD countries, such that applicants with minority-sounding names and male names are discriminated against (especially Arab/Muslim applicants). Thus, ethnic majority women are the most favored in this market in OECD countries while minority men are the most disadvantaged. Moreover, we show the existence of interactions between ethnic and gender discrimination: gender discrimination is greater for minority-sounding names than for majority-sounding names. Finally, it seems that real-estate agents discriminate significantly less against minority applicants than private landlords do. This would seem to be at least in part because private landlords display significant statistical discrimination while real-estate agents do not. These results are robust to the estimation methods used (random effects, fixed-effects, and unrestricted weighted least squares methods).},

abstract = {Purpose The COVID pandemic was a severe blow to all workers, but it may ultimately have a silver lining for some workers with disabilities if it makes work from home easier and more acceptable. In addition, the pandemic is shaking up traditional workplace structures and causing employers to rethink how essential tasks can be done, which may broaden their views of workplace accommodations. We assess the potential for the pandemic to improve employment opportunities for people with disabilities. Methods This article analyzes pre-COVID data on disability and home-based work from three representative data sources-the American Community Survey, American Time Use Survey, and Current Population Survey. We employ both cross-tabulations and regressions to predict work at home. Results We find that workers with disabilities are more likely than those without disabilities both to work primarily from home and to do any work at home. This is true for both employees and self-employed workers. Workers with disabilities face similar wage gaps in on-site and home-based work, indicating that while increased availability of home-based work may create more employment opportunities for workers with disabilities, it is unlikely to erase wage disparities. While workers with disabilities are currently more likely to be working primarily from home, only 34{\%} are in occupations with high potential for home-based work, compared to 40{\%} of workers without disabilities. Conclusions Workers with disabilities are currently more likely to work from home and many may benefit from expanded work-at-home opportunities, but the types of jobs they hold constrain this potential. Research is needed to see how home-based work evolves as the economy recovers from the pandemic over the next several years.},

abstract = {The United States workforce is aging. At the same time more people have chronic conditions, for longer periods. Given these trends the importance of work disability, physical or nervous problems that limit a person's type or amount of work, is increasing. No research has examined transitions among multiple levels of work disability, recovery from work disability, or trends. Limited research has focused on work disability among African Americans and Hispanics, or separately for women and men. We examined these areas using data from 30,563 adults in the 1968–2015 Panel Study of Income Dynamics. We estimated annual probabilities of work disability, recovery, and death with multinomial logistic Markov models. Microsimulations accounting for age and education estimated outcomes for African American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white women and men. Results from these nationally representative data suggested that the majority of Americans experience work disability during working life. Most spells ended with recovery or reduced severity. Among women, African Americans and Hispanics had less moderate and severe work disability than whites. Among men, African Americans became severely work disabled more often than whites, recovered from severe spells more often and had shorter severe spells, yet had more severe work disability at age 65. Hispanic men were more likely to report at least one spell of severe work disability than whites; they also had substantially more recovery from severe work disability, and a lower percentage of working years with work disability. Among African Americans and Hispanics, men were considerably more likely than women to have severe work disability at age 65. Work disability declined significantly across the study period for all groups. Although work disability has declined over several decades, it remains common. Results suggest that the majority of work disability spells end with recovery, underscoring the importance of rehabilitation and workplace accommodation.},

abstract = {The expansion of legal rights to same-sex couples is afoot in a number of Western countries. The effects of this rollout are not only important in their own right but can also provide a window on the institution of marriage and the rights bundled therein. In this article, using Swedish longitudinal register data covering 1994-2007, we study the impact of the extension of rights to same-sex couples on labor earnings and fertility. In 1994, registered partnership for same-sex couples was introduced, which conferred almost all rights and obligations of marriage-a notable exception being joint legal parenting, by default or election. The latter was added in the 2002 adoption act. We find registered partnership to be important to both gays and lesbians but for different reasons. For gays, resource pooling emerges as the main function of registered partnerships. For lesbians, registered partnership appears to be an important vehicle for family formation, especially after the 2002 adoption act. In contrast to heterosexual couples (included for comparison), we find no evidence of household specialization among lesbians. The lack of specialization is noteworthy given similar fertility effects of registered partnership (after 2002) and the fact that lesbian couples were less assortatively matched (on education) than heterosexual couples-children and unequal earnings power being two factors commonly believed to promote specialization.

abstract = {Applied analysts often use the differences-in-differences (DID) method to estimate the causal effect of policy interventions with observational data. The method is widely used, as the required before and after comparison of a treated and control group is commonly encountered in practice. DID removes bias from unobserved time-invariant confounders. While DID removes bias from time-invariant confounders, bias from time-varying confounders may be present. Hence, like any observational comparison, DID studies remain susceptible to bias from hidden confounders. Here, we develop a method of sensitivity analysis that allows investigators to quantify the amount of bias necessary to change a study's conclusions. Our method operates within a matched design that removes bias from observed baseline covariates. We develop methods for both binary and continuous outcomes. We then apply our methods to two different empirical examples from the social sciences. In the first application, we study the effect of changes to disability payments in Germany. In the second, we re-examine whether election day registration increased turnout in Wisconsin.},

abstract = {State film tax incentives have exploded in popularity in the last decade.1 In 2000, only three states offered the subsidies. By 2010, the number of states offering incentives had peaked at 40. As in many states, film subsidies in Alaska have been credited with bringing to the state the economic activity spurred by several productions.2 However, the commonly cited ben- efits of film subsidies are often overstated and fail to take into account offsetting economic effects. This paper will examine the common arguments for film incentives, focusing both on general arguments and arguments specific to Alaska. We will address the following questions: • Can the program make the industry able to sustain itself in the long-term, even when subsidies are cut? • Does the program reduce unemployment, contrib- ute to economic output, and add revenues to the Treasury? • Do the subsidies distort the economy? • Is the program consistent with free speech and an unhampered marketplace of ideas? Key Findings • Film tax credits cost states revenue and require either higher taxes or lower government spending elsewhere. • At best, film tax incentives largely shift production from one sector to another without producing a net increase in economic activity or employment. • However, the program is unlikely to produce a self-sustaining state film industry. • Content restrictions raise concerns about censorship.},

We find that pricing decisions evolve as drivers gain experience with the platform. More-experienced drivers set lower prices and, controlling for price, sell more seats. Our interpretation is that more-experienced drivers on BlaBlaCar learn to lower their prices as they gain experience; accordingly, more-experienced drivers earn more revenue per trip. In total, our results suggest that peer-to-peer markets such as BlaBlaCar share some characteristics with other types of peer-to-peer markets such as eBay but remain a unique and rich setting in which there are many new insights to be gained.},

The new life cycle of employment is initially high and flat, there is a dip in the middle, and a phasing out that is more prolonged than for previous cohorts. The hump is gone, the middle is a bit sagging, and the top has greatly expanded. We explore the increase in cumulative work experience for women from the 1930s to the 1970s birth cohorts using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation and the Health and Retirement Study. We investigate the changing labor force impact of a birth event across cohorts and by education, and also the impact of taking leave or quitting. We find greatly increased labor force experience across cohorts, far less time out after a birth, and greater labor force recovery for those who take paid or unpaid leave. Increased employment of women in their older ages is related to more continuous work experience across the life cycle.},

We explain matching and regression discontinuity approaches in intuitive (nontechnical) terms. To illustrate, we apply these to existing data on the impact of prison facilities on inmate misconduct, which we compare to experimental evidence. What unifies modern approaches to causal inference is the prioritization of research design to createwithout reference to any outcome datasubsets of comparable units. Within those subsets, outcome differences may then be plausibly attributed to exposure to the treatment rather than control condition. Traditional methods of analysis play a small role in this venture. Credible causal inference in law turns on substantive legal, not mathematical, knowledge. {\textcopyright} 2011 by Annual Reviews.

This paper proposes a test that is consistent and approximately UMP unbiased (local to the threshold) when the running variable is discrete. The test exploits the fact that if the discrete running variable—for example, age in quarters—is based on an underlying (but unobserved) variable—such as exact age—with a continuous density, then the observed frequency at the threshold has a known approximate conditional distribution. The resulting test is approximately uniformly most powerful unbiased among tests that use only information at and immediately adjacent to the threshold. The proposed test is applied to vote tally distributions in union representation elections and reveals evidence of manipulation in close elections that is in favor of employers when Republicans control the NLRB and in favor of unions otherwise.},

We employ several methods to estimate the impact and to show that ADA leads to a substantial decline in the motherhood penalty. Before the ADA implementation the average motherhood penalty fluctuated between 12{\%} and 17,5{\%}, after the ADA implementation the statistical significance of motherhood penalty disappeared. However, we also find that wage penalties stemming from the lower work experience due to motherhood-related breaks and lower work intensity during the motherhood are still substantial (10,12{\%}).},

In those years, the state offered a competitively allocated {\$}20,000 incentive called the Governor's Teaching Fellowship (GTF) aimed at attracting academically talented, novice teachers to low-performing schools and retaining them in those schools for at least four years. Taking advantage of data on the career histories of 27,106 individuals who pursued California teaching licenses between 1998 and 2003, we use an instrumental variable strategy to estimate the unbiased impact of the GTF on the decisions of recipients to begin working in low-performing schools within 2 years after licensure program enrollment. We estimate that GTF recipients would have been less likely to teach in low-performing schools than observably similar counterparts had the GTF not existed, but that acquiring a GTF increased their probability of doing so by 28 percentage points. Examining retention patterns, we find that 75 percent of both GTF recipients and nonrecipients who began working in low-performing schools remained in such schools for at least four years.

A survey of the perceptions of young economists supports the formal statistical analysis. Pursuit of T5 publications has become the obsession of the next generation of economists. However, the T5 screen is far from reliable. A substantial share of influential publications appear in non-T5 outlets. Reliance on the T5 to screen talent incentivizes careerism over creativity.},

The authors report findings from the National Latino and Asian American Survey (NLAAS), a national household probability psychiatric survey of 4,488 Latino and Asian American adults. Approximately 4.8{\%} of persons interviewed identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and/or reported recent same-gender sexual experiences. Although few sexual orientation-related differences were observed, among men, gay/bisexual men were more likely than heterosexual men to report a recent suicide attempt. Among women, lesbian/bisexual women were more likely than heterosexual women to evidence positive 1-year and lifetime histories of depressive disorders. These findings suggest a small elevation in psychiatric morbidity risk among Latino and Asian American individuals with a minority sexual orientation. However, the level of morbidity among sexual orientation minorities in the NLAAS appears similar to or lower than that observed in population-based studies of lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults.},

The ability of these experiments to speak to racial discrimination depends on the excludability assumption that subjects' responses to these names are driven by their reaction to the individual's putative race and not some other factor. We use results from an audit study with a large number of aliases and data from detailed public records to empirically test the excludability assumption undergirding the use of racially distinctive names. The detailed public records allow us to measure the signals about socioeconomic status and political resources that each name used in the study possibly could send. We then reanalyze the audit study to see whether these signals predict legislators' likelihood of responding. We find no evidence that politicians respond to this other information, thus providing empirical support for the excludability assumption. },

These models are then fitted to a historical time series of data from 1841 to 2007 and used to predict future population totals to 2033. These results are compared to the most recent projections produced by the Office for National Statistics.

But after the financial crises and Great Recession, in which roughly eight million homes were foreclosed on and about {\$}7 trillion in home equity was erased, economists and policymakers are re-evaluating the role of homeownership in the American Dream. Many question whether the American Dream should really include homeownership or instead focus more on other aspects of upward mobility, and most acknowledge that homeownership is not for everyone. We take a detailed look at US homeownership from three different perspectives: 1) an international perspective, comparing US homeownership rates with those of other nations; 2) a demographic perspective, examining the correlation between changes in the US homeownership rate between 1985 and 2015 and factors like age, race/ethnicity, education, family status, and income; 3) and, a financial benefits perspective, using national data since 2002 to calculate the internal rate of return to homeownership compared to alternative investments. Our overall conclusion: homeownership is a valuable institution. While two decades of policies in the 1990s and early 2000s may have put too much faith in the benefits of homeownership, the pendulum seems to have swung too far the other way, and many now may have too little faith in homeownership as part of the American Dream.},

American Indians joined these debates, often suggesting different explanations. Europeans and Americans also struggled to respond to the disparities, sometimes working to relieve them, sometimes taking advantage of the ill health of American Indians. Economic and political interests have always affected both explanations of health disparities and responses to them, influencing which explanations were emphasized and which interventions were pursued.

We study a special type of regression discontinuity design where the discontinuity in treatment assignment is geographic. In this design, which we call the Geographic Regression Discontinuity (GRD) design, a geographic or administrative boundary splits units into treated and control areas, and analysts make the case that the division into treated and control areas occurs in an as-if random fashion. We show how this design is equivalent to a standard RD with two running variables, but we also clarify several methodological differences that arise in geographical contexts. We also offer a method for estimation of geographically located treatment effects that can also be used to validate the identification assumptions using observable pretreatment characteristics. We illustrate our methodological framework with a re-examination of the effects of political advertisements on voter turnout during a presidential campaign, exploiting the exogenous variation in the volume of presidential ads that is created by media market boundaries.},

We focus on estimation by local linear regression, which was shown to have attractive properties (Porter, J. 2003, “Estimation in the Regression Discontinuity Model” (unpublished, Department of Economics, University of Wisconsin, Madison)). We derive the asymptotically optimal bandwidth under squared error loss. This optimal bandwidth depends on unknown functionals of the distribution of the data and we propose simple and consistent estimators for these functionals to obtain a fully data-driven bandwidth algorithm. We show that this bandwidth estimator is optimal according to the criterion of Li (1987, “Asymptotic Optimality for Cp, CL, Cross-validation and Generalized Cross-validation: Discrete Index Set”, Annals of Statistics, 15, 958–975), although it is not unique in the sense that alternative consistent estimators for the unknown functionals would lead to bandwidth estimators with the same optimality properties. We illustrate the proposed bandwidth, and the sensitivity to the choices made in our algorithm, by applying the methods to a data set previously analysed by Lee (2008, “Randomized Experiments from Non-random Selection in U.S. House Elections”, Journal of Econometrics, 142, 675–697) as well as by conducting a small simulation study.},

We focus on how the effect of career history varies by age, partly in an attempt to reconcile disparate findings in prior studies. While we cannot reconcile earlier findings on the effect of unemployment duration, the findings solidify an emerging consensus on the role of age and employment on callback. First, among applicants across a broad age range, we find that applicants with 52 weeks of unemployment have a lower callback rate than do applicants with shorter unemployment spells. However, regardless of an applicant's age, there is no relationship between spell length and callback among applicants with shorter spells. Second, we find a hump-shaped relationship between age and callback, with both younger and older applicants having a lower probability of callback relative to prime-aged applicants. Finally, we find that those applicants who are employed at the time of application have a lower callback rate than do unemployed applicants, regardless of whether the interim job is of lower or comparable quality relative to the applied-for job. This may reflect a perception among employers that it is harder or more expensive to attract an applicant who is currently employed.},

@article{Walker1969,
abstract = {We are now in the midst of a notable revival of interest in the politics of the American states. During the last decade many studies have been conducted of the social, political and economic determinants of state policy outcomes. Several of these writers have argued that the relative wealth of a state, its degree of industrialization, and other measures of social and economic development are more important in explaining its level of expenditures than such political factors as the form of legislative apportionment, the amount of party competition, or the degree of voter participation. It has been claimed that such factors as the level of personal income or the size of the urban population are responsible both for the degree of participation and party competition in a state, and the nature of the system's policy outputs. By making this argument these writers have called into question the concepts of representation and theories of party and group conflict which, in one form or another, are the foundations for much of American political science. There is a growing awareness, however, that levels of expenditure alone are not an adequate measure of public policy outcomes. Sharkansky has shown, for example, that levels of expenditure and levels of actual service are seldom correlated; presumably, some states are able to reach given service levels with much less expenditure than others.},

@article{Vigdor2008,
abstract = {On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina swept into Louisiana and New Orleans, a city built largely on land reclaimed from swamp, witnessed massive failures in its levees. Much of the city and its surrounding suburbs were inundated; those residents of the city who had not heeded warnings to flee the approaching storm were evacuated in its wake. In less than a week, the city's population declined from over 400,000 to near zero. Census Bureau estimates indicate that almost two years after the storm, by July 1, 2007, nearly half of these evacuees had yet to return. Will the future New Orleans bear any resemblance to the city that existed prior to Katrina? Most government authorities, from city officials to federal spokespersons, insist that New Orleans must -- and should -- be fully rebuilt. Many environmental scientists question whether such a rebuilding would be sensible, given the city's precarious geological position and the contribution of past land reclamation to the city's current vulnerability. The more basic positive question of whether the city will come back, however, is fundamentally an economic one. After Hurricane Katrina, will the city of New Orleans continue to be a preferred location for more than 400,000 residents and their employers? Or will the disaster shift the city to a new equilibrium level of employment and population?},

The estimates exhibit little sensitivity to the degree of flexibility in the specification, and perform very well when we control for unobserved heterogeneity using a first difference specification.

We propose a "jackknife model averaging" (JMA) estimator which selects the weights by minimizing a cross-validation criterion. This criterion is quadratic in the weights, so computation is a simple application of quadratic programming. We show that our estimator is asymptotically optimal in the sense of achieving the lowest possible expected squared error. Monte Carlo simulations and an illustrative application show that JMA can achieve significant efficiency gains over existing model selection and averaging methods in the presence of heteroskedasticity. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Experiments have offered new findings on gender discrimination, and while they have identified a bias against hiring women in some labor market segments, the discrimination detected in field experiments is less pervasive than that implied by the regression approach. Experiments have also offered new insights into gender differences in preferences: women appear to gain less from negotiation, have lower preferences than men for risk and competition, and may be more sensitive to social cues. These gender differences in preferences also have implications in group settings, whereby the gender composition of a group affects team decisions and performance. Most of the evidence on gender traits comes from the lab, and key open questions remain as to the source of gender preferences-nature versus nurture, or their interaction-and their role, if any, in the workplace.},

We use a natural field experiment to test means to attract minority candidates for top professional careers. We randomly vary the content in recruiting materials of a major financial services corporation with over 10,000 employees to signal the extent to which the employer values diversity among its workers. We find that signaling explicit interest in employee diversity has a strong positive effect on interest in openings among racial minority candidates, the likelihood that they apply, and the probability that they are selected. These results uncover an effective method for disrupting monocultures in management through a minor intervention that influences sorting among job-seekers into high-profile careers.},

Taste models, such as researcher, Gary Becker's prototype, produce wage differentials based on the preferences of majority employers, employees, and customers, but of a type which should not generally persist in competitive markets. Statistical models, on the other hand, demonstrate that treating two groups of workers differently may be the rational response of firms to uncertainty about an individual's productivity. In this case, persistent wage differentials may arise between workers with the same productivity who belong to different, identifiable groups, even in competitive markets. A simple model of statistical discrimination and examine the effects of prohibiting group-specific treatment of workers on both net social product and the distribution of income is presented.},

Our results show that, in general, state-owned firms tend to prefer male applicants. Foreign and private firms tend to prefer female applicants. On one hand, this evidence supports the hypothesis that economic reform and the market economy may mitigate gender discrimination. On the other hand, this evidence is consistent with statistics that describe discrimination based on gender segregation and information asymmetry that originated with higher ratios of female workers in foreign and private firms. With respect to regional income disparity, we find that the differences in gender discrimination between first- and second-tier cities are not significant. This result indicates that economic reform exerts limited mitigation effect on discrimination. We also find no evidence of taste discrimination based on traditional son preference in China.},

abstract = {Despite efforts to recruit and retain more women, a stark gender disparity persists within academic science. Abundant research has demonstrated gender bias in many demographic groups, but has yet to experimentally investigate whether science faculty exhibit a bias against female students that could contribute to the gender disparity in academic science. In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student-who was randomly assigned either a male or female name-for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. The gender of the faculty participants did not affect responses, such that female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student. Mediation analyses indicated that the female student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent. We also assessed faculty participants' preexisting subtle bias against women using a standard instrument and found that preexisting subtle bias against women played a moderating role, such that subtle bias against women was associated with less support for the female student, but was unrelated to reactions to the male student. These results suggest that interventions addressing faculty gender bias might advance the goal of increasing the participation of women in science.},

Representing a major advance for meeting this pressing need, cognitive therapy offers a well-documented and demonstrably efficacious psychosocial treatment model. Emanating from the research and practical experience of Aaron T. Beck and his colleagues, this book demonstrates how cognitive therapy can be easily replicated by therapists and counselors alike.

abstract = {The objectives of the study reported in this article were to assess dental student leaders' perceptions of educational efforts concerning lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) topics and the cultural climate concerning LGBT issues in dental schools in the United States and Canada. In addition, the perceptions of student leaders who self-identified as belonging to the LGBT community and of students with a heterosexual orientation were compared. Data were collected from 113 dental student leaders from twenty-seven dental schools in the United States and three in Canada. Fifty student leaders were females, and sixty-two were males. Only 13.3 percent of the respondents agreed that their dental education prepared them well to treat patients from LGBT backgrounds. The more the student leaders believed that their university has an honest interest in diversity, the better they felt prepared by their dental school program to treat patients from LGBT backgrounds (r=.327; p{\textless}.001). The better they felt prepared, the more they perceived the clinic environment as sensitive and affirming for patients with different sexual orientations (r=.464; p{\textless}.001). The more they reported that dental schools' administrations create a positive environment for students with LGBT orientations, the more they agreed that persons can feel comfortable regardless of their sexual orientation (r=.585; p{\textless}.001). In conclusion, the findings indicate that dental school administrators play an important role in ensuring that future care providers are well prepared to treat patients from LGBT backgrounds and that staff, faculty, students, and patients from these backgrounds are not discriminated against.},

abstract = {Consider a researcher estimating the parameters of a regression function based on data for all 50 states in the United States or on data for all visits to a website. What is the interpretation of the estimated parameters and the standard errors? In practice, researchers typically assume that the sample is randomly drawn from a large population of interest and report standard errors that are designed to capture sampling variation. This is common even in applications where it is difficult to articulate what that population of interest is, and how it differs from the sample. In this article, we explore an alternative approach to inference, which is partly design‐based. In a design‐based setting, the values of some of the regressors can be manipulated, perhaps through a policy intervention. Design‐based uncertainty emanates from lack of knowledge about the values that the regression outcome would have taken under alternative interventions. We derive standard errors that account for design‐based uncertainty instead of, or in addition to, sampling‐based uncertainty. We show that our standard errors in general are smaller than the usual infinite‐population sampling‐based standard errors and provide conditions under which they coincide.},

However, there is little causal evidence that speaks to this theory. Using a rich data set on the entire population of Norway over an extended period of time, we examine the effects of family size and birth order on the educational attainment of children. We find a negative correlation between family size and children's education, but when we include indicators for birth order or use twin births as an instrument, family size effects become negligible. In addition, higher birth order has a significant and large negative effect on children's education. We also study adult earnings, employment, and teenage childbearing and find strong evidence for birth order effects with these outcomes, particularly among women. These findings suggest the need to revisit economic models of fertility and child "production," focusing not only on differences across families but differences within families as well.},

The survey found that the majority of Americans are uninformed about health care disparities--many were unaware that blacks fare worse than whites on measures such as infant mortality and life expectancy, and that Latinos are less likely than whites to have health insurance. Views on whether the health system treats people equally were strikingly different by race. For example, most minority Americans perceive that they get lower quality care than whites, but most whites think otherwise. Nonetheless, more minority Americans were concerned about the cost of care than racial barriers. Efforts to eliminate disparities will need to improve public awareness of the problems as well as address racial and financial barriers to care},

Pearson correlations supported several hypotheses; social norms and masculinity variables were significantly related to health risk behaviors. Four multiple regression analyses indicated that masculinity and perceptions of social norms predicted health risk behaviors.

abstract = {In the late 1980s, a series of legal rulings favorable to tribes and the subsequent passage of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 legalized gaming operations on reservations in many states. Today, there are over 310 gaming operations run by more than 200 of the nations' 556 federally-recognized tribes. Of these operations, about 220 are Las Vegas' style casinos with slot machines and/or table games. We use a simple difference-in-difference framework where we compare economic outcomes before and after tribes open casinos to outcomes over the same period for tribes that do not adopt or are prohibited from adopting gaming. Four years after tribes open casinos, employment has increased by 26 percent, and tribal population has increased by about 12 percent, resulting in an increase in employment to population ratios of five percentage points or about 12 percent. The fraction of adults who work but are poor has declined by 14 percent. Tribal gaming operations seem to have both positive and negative spillovers in the surrounding communities. In counties where an Indian-owned casino opens, we find that jobs per adult increase by about five percent of the median value. Given the size of tribes relative to their counties, most of this growth in employment is due to growth in non-Native American employment. The increase in economic activity appears to have some health benefits in that four or more years after a casino opens, mortality has fallen by 2 percent in a county with a casino and an amount half that in counties near a casino. Casinos do, however, come at some cost. Four years after a casino opens, bankruptcy rates, violent crime, and auto thefts and larceny are up 10 percent in counties with a casino.},

abstract = {Are small or large outgroup populations more closely related to an ingroup's prejudice? This paper addresses this question with national probability survey data from Germany focused on resident foreigners. Two interlocking processes underlie the complex relationship between population proportions and prejudice. Typically, larger outgroup population proportions simultaneously increase both threat and intergroup contact. The first process increases prejudice, the second decreases it. Using structural equation modelling, our analysis reveals that these two processes can be effectively combined into one complex model. Threat is perceptual; it involves what people think is the outgroup proportion and thus can be easily manipulated by political leaders and the mass media. Contact is experiential; it can reduce individual and collective threat as well as prejudice. The intricate relationship between threat and contact can be substantially altered by numerous moderators. Hence, rigid group segregation can limit contact, while unemployment can amplify threat. The paper provides evidence that reductions in prejudice have important consequences for intergroup relations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {This paper reports the results of the first systematic attempt at quantitatively measuring the seminar culture within economics and testing whether it is gender neutral. We collected data on every interaction between presenters and their audience in hundreds of research seminars and job market talks across most leading economics departments, as well as during summer conferences. We find that women presenters are treated differently than their male counterparts. Women are asked more questions during a seminar and the questions asked of women presenters are more likely to be patronizing or hostile. These effects are not due to women presenting in different fields, different seminar series, or different topics, as our analysis controls for the institution, seminar series, and JEL codes associated with each presentation. Moreover, it appears that there are important differences by field and that these differences are not uniformly mitigated by more rigid seminar formats. Our findings add to an emerging literature documenting ways in which women economists are treated differently than men, and suggest yet another potential explanation for their under-representation at senior levels within the economics profession.

abstract = {In this article, we introduce three commands to conduct robust data-driven statistical inference in regression-discontinuity (RD) designs. First, we present rdrobust, a command that implements the robust bias-corrected confidence intervals proposed in Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014d, Econometrica 82: 2295–2326) for average treatment effects at the cutoff in sharp RD, sharp kink RD, fuzzy RD, and fuzzy kink RD designs. This command also implements other conventional nonparametric RD treatment-effect point estimators and confidence intervals. Second, we describe the companion command rdbwselect, which implements several bandwidth selectors proposed in the RD literature. Following the results in Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014a, Working paper, University of Michigan), we also introduce rdplot, a command that implements several data-driven choices of the number of bins in evenly spaced and quantile-spaced partitions that are used to construct the RD plots usually encountered in empirical applications. A companion R package is described in Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014b, Working paper, University of Michigan).},

Population-based data are from the California Quality of Life Surveys, which included 1,478 sexual minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and homosexually experienced individuals) and 3,465 heterosexual individuals. Bisexual women had a nearly six-fold increased risk of lifetime suicide attempts than heterosexual women (RR = 5.88, 95{\%}CI: 3.89-8.90), and homosexually experienced men had almost 7 times higher risk of lifetime suicide attempts than heterosexual men (RR = 6.93, 95{\%}CI: 3.65-13.15). Sexual minority men and women were more likely than heterosexual men and women to have disclosed suicide attempts to a medical professional (RR = 1.48 and RR = 1.44, respectively). Among persons who ever attempted suicide, sexual minority women had a younger age of index attempt than heterosexual women (15.9 vs. 19.6 years of age, respectively). Healthcare professionals should be aware of suicidal risk heterogeneity among sexual minority individuals, including vulnerable points of risk and evidenced-based treatments.},

Even though the research and clinical literature demonstrate that same-sex sexual and romantic attractions, feelings, and behaviors are normal and positive variations of human sexuality, regardless of sexual orientation identity, the task force concluded that the population that undergoes SOCE tends to have strongly conservative religious views that lead them to seek to change their sexual orientation. Thus, the appropriate application of affirmative therapeutic interventions for those who seek SOCE involves therapist acceptance, support, and understanding of clients and the facilitation of clients active coping, social support, and identity exploration and development, without imposing a specific sexual orientation identity outcome.},

In contrast, Lyft drivers observe the name before accepting a ride and, as expected, we find no effect of name on cancellations.

abstract = {Retirement is characterised as a dynamic process that has several different outcomes, from early retirement to re-entry to the labour force. Recent studies of the Dutch population show that a substantial number of early retirees re-enter the workforce after early retirement, but others do not succeed even though they want to return to paid work. An often-named reason for their failures is bias in the selection process. This raises the questions as to what restrictions do early retirees face in the labour market and what are the characteristics that enhance or limit their hiring chances? The aim of this study was to identify the individual and organisational characteristics that influence managers' hiring decisions, and for the purpose a vignette study among Dutch managers and business students was conducted. Profiles of hypothetical early retirees were presented to the respondents who were then asked to make decisions whether of not to employ the individual. The results show that hiring early retirees is of low priority to both managers and students, and depends to a large extent on organisational factors (such as personnel shortages) and the age of the retiree. The findings suggest that despite equal opportunities policies, age discrimination is still present on the Dutch labour market and that managers generally hinder the re-employment of workers approaching the retirement age.},

abstract = {Discrimination is long seen as a meaningful factor for ethnic inequalities on rental housing markets. Yet empirically, the extent of discrimination is still debatable. For the first time, this article provides a quantitative meta-analysis of field experiments (in person audits and correspondence tests) that were run over the last four decades in the United States, Canada and Europe (N = 71). Special focus is given to a possible inflation of effect sizes by publication bias; to time trends; and to evidence for statistical discrimination. Taken together, nearly all experiments document the occurrence of ethnic discrimination. Effect sizes are inflated by publication bias, but there is still substantial evidence left once the bias is removed. The analysis reveals a consistent decline in the extent of discrimination over time, from moderate levels of discrimination in the 1970s and 1980s, up to only small but still statistically significant levels in the 1990s and 2000s. A significant part of the discriminatory behaviour can be attributed to missing information about the social status of applicants, which supports theories on statistical discrimination. It is discussed how future research could move our knowledge on the underlying mechanisms forward.},

abstract = {We propose strategies to estimate and make inference on key features of heterogeneous effects in randomized experiments. These key features include best linear predictors of the effects using machine learning proxies, average effects sorted by impact groups, and average characteristics of most and least impacted units. The approach is valid in high dimensional settings, where the effects are proxied by machine learning methods. We post-process these proxies into the estimates of the key features. Our approach is generic, it can be used in conjunction with penalized methods, deep and shallow neural networks, canonical and new random forests, boosted trees, and ensemble methods. It does not rely on strong assumptions. In particular, we don't require conditions for consistency of the machine learning methods. Estimation and inference relies on repeated data splitting to avoid overfitting and achieve validity. For inference, we take medians of p-values and medians of confidence intervals, resulting from many different data splits, and then adjust their nominal level to guarantee uniform validity. This variational inference method is shown to be uniformly valid and quantifies the uncertainty coming from both parameter estimation and data splitting. We illustrate the use of the approach with two randomized experiments in development on the effects of microcredit and nudges to stimulate immunization demand.},

abstract = {Preface The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is a longitudinal household survey data set for the study of retirement and health among the elderly in the United States. It is extraordinarily rich and complex. With the goal of making the data more accessible to researchers, the RAND Center for the Study of Aging, with funding and support from the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the Social Security Administration (SSA), created the RAND HRS data files. This document describes the RAND HRS data. The RAND HRS is a user-friendly version of a subset of the HRS. It contains cleaned and processed variables with consistent and intuitive naming conventions, model-based imputations and imputation flags, and spousal counterparts of most individual-level variables. All is elaborately documented, with special attention to comparability of variables across survey waves. The RAND HRS is the result of three distinct data developments. With funding from the NIA, we created so-called Fat Files of each survey wave. In these files, the unit of observation is an individual respondent. They contain most unrestricted HRS Variables. Household-level variables were assigned to its member records, information about spouses that was collected from the financially knowledgeable household member was re-assigned to the spousal record, and many data integrity checks were performed. With funding from the SSA, we created a longitudinal file with consistent naming conventions and imputations. Unlike the Fat Files, this longitudinal file contained only a subset of variables. It also contained some restricted variables. With subsequent funding from SSA through the Michigan Retirement Research Center (MRRC), we removed restricted data from the longitudinal file, added new cohorts and survey waves, new variables, and, in collaboration with HRS staff, made the file publicly available on the HRS website.},

It examines data compiled from an experiment conducted in 2005-6 in which two qualitatively identical applications, one with a woman's name on it and the other with a man's name, were sent to employers advertising positions in Stockholm and Gothenburg (the two largest labor markets in Sweden). The study adds to previous international field experiments by providing additional analysis of the Swedish labor market to determine whether hiring discrimination is a primary cause of occupational gender segregation. The results show that, on average, women have a somewhat higher callback rate to interview in female-dominated occupations, while in male-dominated occupations there is no evidence of gender difference. These findings suggest that the bulk of the prevailing gender segregation in Sweden cannot be explained by discrimination in hiring.},

abstract = {A number of studies have demonstrated wide disparities in health among racial/ethnic groups and by gender, yet few have examined how race/ethnicity and gender intersect or combine to affect the health of older adults. The tendency of prior research to treat race/ethnicity and gender separately has potentially obscured important differences in how health is produced and maintained, undermining efforts to eliminate health disparities. The current study extends previous research by taking an intersectionality approach (Mullings {\&} Schulz, 2006), grounded in life course theory, conceptualizing and modeling trajectories of functional limitations as dynamic life course processes that are jointly and simultaneously defined by race/ethnicity and gender. Data from the nationally representative 1994-2006 US Health and Retirement Study and growth curve models are utilized to examine racial/ethnic/gender differences in intra-individual change in functional limitations among White, Black and Mexican American Men and Women, and the extent to which differences in life course capital account for group disparities in initial health status and rates of change with age. Results support an intersectionality approach, with all demographic groups exhibiting worse functional limitation trajectories than White Men. Whereas White Men had the lowest disability levels at baseline, White Women and racial/ethnic minority Men had intermediate disability levels and Black and Hispanic Women had the highest disability levels. These health disparities remained stable with age-except among Black Women who experience a trajectory of accelerated disablement. Dissimilar early life social origins, adult socioeconomic status, marital status, and health behaviors explain the racial/ethnic disparities in functional limitations among Men but only partially explain the disparities among Women. Net of controls for life course capital, Women of all racial/ethnic groups have higher levels of functional limitations relative to White Men and Men of the same race/ethnicity. Findings highlight the utility of an intersectionality approach to understanding health disparities. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Objective: This study investigated racial and ethnic disparities in psychotherapy use and expenditures in the United States and identified important factors associated with these disparities. Methods: Using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey from 1996 to 2006, the investigators performed bivariate and multivariable analyses to estimate racial and ethnic disparities in the probability of receiving any psychotherapy, total psychotherapy expenditures, and out-of-pocket-payment share for 7,376 patients with depressive or anxiety disorders. Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition techniques were used to identify the most important factors associated with these disparities. Results: Caucasians were more likely to use psychotherapy than Latinos (57{\%} versus 52{\%}, p{\textless}.001), but there was no significant difference between Caucasians and African Americans in the probability of receiving any psychotherapy. Caucasians self-paid 29{\%} of the total cost for each visit, significantly higher than the shares paid by Latinos (19{\%}) and African Americans (14{\%}). Racial-ethnic differences in the propensity to utilize psychotherapy vanished in multivariable regression, but Caucasians still paid a significantly higher out-of-pocket share than others. English proficiency was the most important factor associated with racial-ethnic disparities in psychotherapy use. The extensive Medicaid coverage among Latinos and African Americans was the main reason for their lower out-of-pocket payment for psychotherapy compared with Caucasians. Conclusions: This study found little evidence of racial and ethnic disparities in access to psychotherapy services. Health care reforms affecting mental health coverage under Medicaid would significantly affect psychotherapy expenditure and use among Latinos and African Americans.},

abstract = {Relying on a commonly used fixed-offer bargaining script we examine gender differences in bargaining outcomes in a highly competitive and frequently used market: the taxi market in Lima, Peru. Our bargaining script secures that only the seller can change prices and terminate negotiations, thus we are able to examine differences in the seller's entire path of negotiation and in the reservation price at which they are willing to trade. We find that male and female passengers who use the same bargaining script are not treated equally. Men face higher initial prices, final prices, and rejection rates. These differences are consistent with male drivers being more reluctant to give-in to demanding negotiations by male passengers, and with male passengers being perceived as having high valuations. To identify whether taste-based or statistical discrimination drives the inferior treatment of men we conduct an experiment where passengers send a signal on valuation before negotiating. The signal eliminates gender differences and the response is shown only to be consistent with statistical discrimination. Thus in the limiting case of a highly competitive market with experienced traders, we do not find evidence of taste-based discrimination, the differential observed is however consistent with statistical discrimination. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

The second paper analyzes the post-ADA employment outcomes among people with disabilities. Employment of people with disabilities has become an important policy issue in the past 15 years. Their low employment levels were a major factor behind the passage of the ADA and the 1999 Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act. As further evidence of policy attention, the 2000 federal budget created a new Office of Disability Employment Policy in the U.S. Department of Labor, headed by a deputy secretary confirmed by the Senate. This topic attracts attention in part due to the large number of people with disabilities and consequently the large number of employers that deal with employees and applicants with disabilities who will continue to recruit in this population to help alleviate projected labor shortages.},

We examined the extent to which a recent experience of a major discriminatory event may contribute to poor mental health among LGBT persons. Methods. Data were derived from a cross-sectional strata-cluster survey of adults in Hennepin County, Minnesota, who identified as LGBT (n = 472) or heterosexual (n = 7,412). Results. Compared to heterosexuals, LGBT individuals had poorer mental health (higher levels of psychological distress, greater likelihood of having a diagnosis of depression or anxiety, greater perceived mental health needs, and greater use of mental health services), more substance use (higher levels of binge drinking, greater likelihood of being a smoker and greater number of cigarettes smoked per day), and were more likely to report unmet mental healthcare needs. LGBT individuals were also more likely to report having experienced a major incident of discrimination over the past year than heterosexual individuals. Although perceived discrimination was associated with almost all of the indicators of mental health and utilization of mental health care that we examined, adjusting for discrimination did not significantly reduce mental health disparities between heterosexual and LGBT persons. Conclusion. LGBT individuals experienced more major discrimination and reported worse mental health than heterosexuals, but discrimination did not account for this disparity. Future research should explore additional forms of discrimination and additional stressors associated with minority sexual orientation that may account for these disparities.},

A series of robustness checks show that these patterns are stronger among higher educated workers; that the sorting of altruistic people to the public sector takes place only within the caring industries; and that the difference in altruism is already present at the start of people's career, while the difference in laziness is only present for employees with sufficiently long work experience.},

abstract = {Rent control is usually introduced to economics students as a price ceiling and an unambiguous source of inefficiency. Early rent controls mirrored price ceilings, but by the late 20th century the majority of controls had developed into complex systems. This paper organizes the judgments of economists regarding the impact of rent controls in the American context. Research is limited to journal articles listed by the American Economic Association's electronic bibliography, EconLit, under the subject search "Rent Control" performed February 18th, 2008. Articles must also meet the following criteria: the article focuses on rent control policies; data come from U.S. cities; and at least one author must be an economist. An economist is defined as any individual who holds a degree in the field of economics. I focus on the articles generated by the search in EconLit, but also include articles not in the EconLit search, but referenced by articles that are. I have been scrupulous to include any such once-removed articles that go against the main tendency of the literature, and hence assure the reader that my efforts have not accommodated a "picking and choosing" bias on my part. I find that the preponderance of the literature points toward the conclusion that rent control introduces inefficiencies in housing markets. Moreover, the literature on the whole does not sustain any plausible redemption in terms of redistribution. The literature on the whole may be fairly said to show that rent control is bad, yet as of 2001, about 140 jurisdictions persist in some form of the intervention.},

abstract = {The view that the returns to educational investments are highest for early childhood interventions is widely held and stems primarily from several influential randomized trials—Abecedarian, Perry, and the Early Training Project—that point to super-normal returns to early interventions. This article presents a de novo analysis of these experiments, focusing on two core issues that have received limited attention in previous analyses: treatment effect heterogeneity by gender and overrejection of the null hypothesis due to multiple inference. To address the latter issue, a statistical framework that combines summary index tests with familywise error rate and false discovery rate corrections is implemented. The first technique reduces the number of tests conducted; the latter two techniques adjust the p values for multiple inference. The primary finding of the reanalysis is that girls garnered substantial short- and long-term benefits from the interventions, but there were no significant long-term benefits for boys. These conclusions, which have appeared ambiguous when using “naive” estimators that fail to adjust for multiple testing, contribute to a growing literature on the emerging female–male academic achievement gap. They also demonstrate that in complex studies where multiple questions are asked of the same data set, it can be important to declare the family of tests under consideration and to either consolidate measures or report adjusted and unadjusted p values.},

abstract = {Academic research and popular writing on nonmonogamy and polyamory has so far paid insufficient attention to class divisions and questions of political economy. This is striking since research indicates the significance of class and race privilege within many polyamorous communities. This structure of privilege is mirrored in the exclusivist con-struction of these communities. The article aims to fill the gap created by the silence on class by suggesting a research agenda which is attentive to class and socioeconomic inequality. The paper addresses relevant research questions in the areas of intimacy and care, household formation, and spaces and institutions and advances an intersectional perspective which incorporates class as nondispensable core category. The author suggests that critical research in the field can stimulate critical self-reflexive practice on the level of community relations and activism. He further points to the critical relevance of Marxist and Postmarxist theories as important resources for the study of polyamory and calls for the study of the contradic-tions within poly culture from a materialist point of view. Over recent years, polyamory has received a significant amount of attention in mainstream media, popular psychology and social science literature. Sheff and Hammers (2011, p. 201) describe polyamory as " a form of association in which people openly maintain multiple romantic, sexual and/or affective relationships " . For a long time, the term was only used among small circles of people, who took an interest in countercultural debates on consensual nonmonogamy. This situation has changed in the face of community building and campaigning work by activists and the popularisation of the concept in mass-marketed pop-psychological relationship manuals (Klesse 2007). Mainstream media accounts often stereotype polyamorists as delusional and narcissistic, but positive representations are no longer exceptions (Ritchie 2010; Ritchie and Barker 2006). Although polyamory is still an under-researched topic, there has been a steady growth of research, which took off with the publication of several pioneering texts by activists and activists/scholars in the 1990s and gained momentum in the early-mid 2000s (Barker and Langdridge 2011). The common lack of engagement with power relations is a striking feature of the emerging polyamory debate across the genres of self-help, activist, and Int J Polit Cult Soc (2014) 27:203–220},

Advocates of the EITC argue that, unlike traditional welfare, the credit helps "promote both the values of family and work". Indeed, empirical evidence consistent with economic theory suggests that the EITC promotes employment among eligible unmarried women with children. To target benefits to lower-income families, however, the EITC is based on family income, leading to traditional welfare-type disincentives for most eligible secondary earners. In fact, the EITC is likely to reduce overall family labor supply among married couples.This paper examines the labor force participation response of married couples to EITC expansions between 1984 and 1996. The effect of the credit is estimated using both quasi-experimental and traditional reduced-form labor supply models. Results from both models show the same qualitative conclusion, that the EITC expansions reduced total family labor supply of married couples. In all cases, we find a decline in labor force participation by married women that more than offsets any rise in participation by their spouses. While the labor force participation rate of married men increased by about 0.2 percentage points, that of married women decreased by just over a full percentage point. These aggregate effects mask substantial heterogeneity in the population. Women facing the strongest disincentives were more than 2 percentage points less likely to work after the expansions. These findings imply that the EITC is effectively subsidizing married mothers to stay home, and therefore, have implications for the design of the program. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Applied researchers often combine Difference In Differences (DID) with conditioning on pre-treatment outcomes when the Parallel Trend Assumption (PTA) fails. I examine both the theoretical and empirical basis for this approach. I show that the theoretical argument that both methods combine their strengths-DID differenc-ing out the permanent confounders while conditioning on pre-treatment outcomes captures the transitory ones-is incorrect. Worse, conditioning on pre-treatment outcomes might increase the bias of DID. Simulations of a realistic model of earnings dynamics and selection in a Job Training Program (JTP) show that this bias can be sizable in practice. Revisiting empirical studies comparing DID with RCTs, I also find that conditioning on pre-treatment outcomes increases the bias of DID. Taken together, these results suggest that we should not combine DID with conditioning on pre-treatment outcomes but rather use DID conditioning on covariates that are fixed over time. When the PTA fails, DID applied symmetrically around the treatment date performs well in simulations and when compared with RCTs. Matching on several observations of pre-treatment outcomes also performs well in simulations, but evidence on its empirical performance is lacking. Tel: +33 (0)5 61 12 88 28.

This book gives practical strategies to become more engaged with the public on a variety of fronts: online, in print, at council hearings, even national legislation. M. V. Lee Badgett, herself a veteran policy analyst and public intellectual with more than twenty-five years of experience connecting cutting-edge research with policy makers and the public, shows you how to find and develop relationships with the people who can take your research and ideas into places scholars rarely go, and who can get you into congressional hearings, on NPR, or into the pages of the New York Times. Learn how to use research to change minds, and turn your knowledge into clear and compelling messages to use in interviews, blog posts, tweets, and op-eds. The work of academics can matter and be influential on a public level, but the path to becoming a public intellectual, influential policy advisor, valued community resource, or go-to person on an issue is not one that most scholars are trained for.

As an epidemiologist, I call upon economists to join with us in combating COVID-19 and in preventing future pandemics. In this essay, I attempt to provide some insight for economists into how epidemiology works, where it doesn't work, and the much-needed answers that economists can help us obtain.

This might prompt older Americans to seek out opportunities in self-employment. Alternatively, recession-related decreases in economic activity might make self-employment less attractive. Using the Health and Retirement Study, we find that unemployed respondents are more likely to enter self-employment and that these decisions are clearly affected by recessions, although the effects differ by recession and gender. Unlike men, women's self-employment decisions are very sensitive to other sources of household income, and women are less likely to become self-employed the deeper the recession.},

abstract = {In Lazear's (1979) model of efficient long-term incentive contracts, employers impose involuntary retirement based on age. This model implies that age discrimination laws, which bar involuntary terminations based on age, discourage the use of such contracts and reduce efficiency. Alternatively, by making it costly for firms to dismiss older workers paid in excess of their marginal product, such laws may serve as precommitment devices that make credible the long-term commitment to workers that firms must make under Lazear contracts. Given that employers remain able to use financial incentives to induce retirement, age discrimination laws may instead strengthen the bonds between workers and firms and encourage efficient Lazear contracts. We assess evidence on these alternative interpretations of age discrimination laws by estimating the effects of such laws on the steepness of age-earnings profiles. If long-term incentive contracts are strengthened or become more prevalent, average age-earnings profiles should steepen for workers who enter the labor" market after age discrimination laws are passed, and vice versa. The empirical analysis uses decennial Censuses of Population and state-level variation in age discrimination laws induced by state and federal legislation. The evidence indicates that age discrimination laws lead to steeper age-earnings profiles for cohorts entering the labor market, suggesting that these laws encourage the use of Lazear contracts, and increase efficiency.

These themes include education burdening, gender inflation, gender narrowing, gender avoidance, gender generalizing, gender repairing, gender pathologizing, and gate-keeping. Findings indicate that psycho-therapists might make errors in overemphasizing, underemphasizing, or stigmatizing TGNC identities in psychotherapy sessions. Psychotherapy missteps also reflected problems related to placing the burden of education on the client, overasserting power, or performing care in a perfunctory manner.

We show how to construct these weights in various settings, including situations where units opt into the treatment sequentially. The resulting estimator converges to an average (over units and time) treatment effect under the correct specification of the assignment model. We show that our estimator is more robust than the conventional two-way estimator: it remains consistent if either the assignment mechanism or the two-way regression model is correctly specified and performs better than the two-way-fixed-effect estimator if both are locally misspecified. This strong double robustness property quantifies the benefits from modeling the assignment process and motivates using our estimator in practice.},

abstract = {Given their capacity to identify causal relationships, experimental audit studies have grown increasingly popular in the social sciences. Typically, investigators send fictitious auditors who differ by a key factor (e.g., race) to particular experimental units (e.g., employers) and then compare treatment and control groups on a dichotomous outcome (e.g., hiring). In such scenarios, an important design consideration is the power to detect a certain magnitude difference between the groups. But power calculations are not straightforward in standard matched tests for dichotomous outcomes. Given the paired nature of the data, the number of pairs in the concordant cells (when neither or both auditor receives a positive response) contributes to the power, which is lower as the sum of the discordant proportions approaches one. Because these quantities are difficult to determine a priori, researchers must exercise particular care in experimental design. We here present sample size and power calculations for McNemar's test using empirical data from an audit study on misdemeanor arrest records and employability. We then provide formulas and examples for cases involving more than two treatments (Cochran's Q test) and nominal outcomes (Stuart–Maxwell test). We conclude with concrete recommendations concerning power and sample size for researchers designing and presenting matched audit studies.},

abstract = {Objectives: The study examined availability of psychiatrists for outpatient appointments in three U.S. cities. Methods: Posing as patients, investigators called 360 psychiatrists listed in a major insurer's database in Boston, Houston, and Chicago (N=120 per city) and attempted to make appointments. Callers claimed to have Blue Cross Blue Shield or Medicare or said they would pay out of pocket (N=120 per payer type, divided evenly across cities). Results: In round 1 of calling, investigators were able to reach 119 of the 360 psychiatrists (33{\%}). Of 216 unanswered calls, 36{\%} were returned. After two calling rounds, appointments were made with 93 psychiatrists (26{\%}). Significant differences were noted between cities but not between payer type. Conclusions: Obtaining outpatient appointments with psychiatrists in three cities was difficult, irrespective of payer. Results suggest that expanding insurance coverage alone may do little to improve access to psychiatrists-or worse, expansion might further overwhelm the capacity of available services.},

To understand whether and when discrimination manifests in for-hire vehicle services, I conducted an audit of Uber, Lyft, and taxis in Los Angeles. Discrimination against black taxi riders resulted in far higher rates of trip cancellation and longer wait times compared with white riders. By contrast, ride-hailing dramatically reduced differences between riders. Findings suggest that discrimination occurs when people learn of rider characteristics and yield implications for how planners can use technology to deter discrimination.},

We developed fictitious female white and Arab American identities and used the audit method to respond to 560 roommate-wanted advertisements in four metro areas: Los Angeles, New York, Detroit, and Houston. To focus on social-rather than purely economic-biases, all responses identified the sender as college-educated and employed and were written in grammatically correct English. We compare the number of replies received, finding that Arab-origin names receive about 40 percent fewer replies. We then model variation in discrimination rates by proximity to mosques, geographic concentration of mosques, and the percentage of Arabs living in a census tract so as to test ethnic competition theory and the contact hypothesis. In Los Angeles and New York, greater discrimination occurred in neighborhoods with the highest concentration of mosques.

Employer callbacks to attractive men are significantly higher than to men with no picture and to plain-looking men, nearly doubling the latter group. Strikingly, attractive women do not enjoy the same beauty premium. In fact, women with no picture have a significantly higher rate of callback than attractive or plain-looking women. We explore a number of explanations for this discrimination against attractive women and provide evidence that female jealousy and envy are likely reasons.

The chapters examine the role of analytics and data science to create, spread, develop and utilize analytics applications for practice. Selected chapters provide a good balance between discussing research advances and pedagogical tools in key topic areas in analytics and data science in a systematic manner. This book also focuses on several business applications of these emerging technologies in decision making, i.e., business analytics. The chapters in Analytics and Data Science: Advances in Research and Pedagogy are written by leading academics and practitioners that participated at the Business Analytics Congress 2015. Applications of analytics and data science technologies in various domains are still evolving. For instance, the explosive growth in big data and social media analytics requires examination of the impact of these technologies and applications on business and society. As organizations in various sectors formulate their IT strategies and investments, it is imperative to understand how various analytics and data science approaches contribute to the improvements in organizational information processing and decision making. Recent advances in computational capacities coupled by improvements in areas such as data warehousing, big data, analytics, semantics, predictive and descriptive analytics, visualization, and real-time analytics have particularly strong implications on the growth of analytics and data science.},

abstract = {This paper uses a laboratory experiment with eye-tracking and about 6,000 unique randomized resumes to explore the effects of race on employment discrimination over the life cycle for experienced applicants in their mid 30s to 70s. We find striking evidence of race discrimination against prime-age Black job applicants that diminishes into middle age before re-emerging for older applicants. Screeners in professional programs mechanically process Black and White resumes similarly, but spend less time on resumes for the younger Black applicants. We find evidence of levels-based statistical discrimination, suggesting that screeners believe younger Black applicants to have worse computer skills and more gaps in their job histories. We also find evidence for variance-based statistical discrimination against Black applicants of all ages, suggesting that screeners perceive the job history signal to be stronger for White applicants than for Black, disproportionately affecting older Black applicants. Evidence from a smaller companion study using Human Resources (HR) managers and from the Current Population Survey (CPS) supports the external validity of our experiment, particularly for female job applicants. Results are robust to a number of different controls and specification choices.},

abstract = {One of the main problems in using environmental cost-benefit analysis is deciding on the relevant population: whose benefits should we count? This is important since aggregate benefits depend on both per-person benefit and the number of beneficiaries. Yet this latter term is often hard to evaluate. Distance-decay functions are one way of addressing this problem. In this paper, we present estimates of distance-decay functions for a particular environmental improvement, namely a reduction in low flow problems on the River Mimram in Southern England. We do this both for users and non-users, in the context of a contingent valuation study of the benefits of improving low flow conditions. We test whether distance-decay effects for mean Willingness to Pay are stronger for a single environmental good (the River Mimram, in this case) than for a more inclusive set (here, all rivers in Thames region which suffer from low flow problems). Finally, we explore the impact on part-whole bias, in terms of the relationship between WTP for an individual site and WTP for a more inclusive group of sites, of allowing for distance-decay effects. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Moreover, efforts to improve minority health care face challenges that differ from those confronted during de jure segregation. We review these challenges and examine whether stronger enforcement of existing civil rights legislation could help overcome them. We conclude that stronger enforcement of existing laws-for example, through executive orders to strengthen enforcement of the laws and congressional action to allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against providers who might have engaged in discrimination-would improve minority health care, but this approach is limited in what it can achieve. Complementary approaches outside the legal arena, such as quality improvement efforts and direct transfers of money to minority-serving providers-those seeing a disproportionate number of minority patients relative to their share of the population-might prove to be more effective.},

Clinicians and trainees (n = 100) made treatment decisions (opioid, antidepressant, pain specialty referral, mental health referral) for 16 computer-simulated patients with chronic low back pain. Patients' sex, race and depression status were manipulated across vignettes (image and text).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Individual- and group-level analyses indicated that patient's depression status had the strongest and most consistent influence on treatment decisions.

Place based policies have the potential to profoundly affect the location of economic activity, along with the wages, employment, and industry mix of communities. These programs are widespread in the U.S. and throughout the world, but have only recently been studied closely by economists. We consider the following questions: Who benefits from place based interventions? Do the national benefits outweigh the costs? What sorts of interventions are most likely to be effective?To study these questions, we develop a simple spatial equilibrium model designed to characterize the welfare effects of place based policies on the local and the national economy. Using this model, we critically evaluate the economic rationales for place based policies and assess the latest evidence on their effects. We conclude with some lessons for policy and directions for future research.},

abstract = {Is bridge job prevalence reduced significantly if a change in occupation is required in addition to the hours and tenure requirements that typically define bridge job employment? Prior research has shown that the majority of older Americans with career employment do not exit the labor force directly from their careers. Rather, most career individuals take on a "bridge job" later in life, that is, a job that follows full-time career (FTC) employment and precedes complete labor force withdrawal (i.e., retirement). One criticism of this finding is that bridge job prevalence may be overstated because the definition of a bridge job in the existing literature does not require a change in occupation. This paper investigates the extent to which bridge jobs involve a change in occupation or a switch to part-time status, both of which may signal retirement transitions as opposed to continued career employment, albeit with a different employer. We use the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally-representative longitudinal dataset of older Americans that began in 1992 as the basis for our analysis. We find that, among HRS respondents who were on a FTC job at the time of the first interview and who changed jobs in subsequent waves, 48 percent of the men and 40 percent of the women also changed occupations, using 2-digit occupation codes. Further, when hours worked are also considered, we find that more than three quarters of FTC respondents who changed jobs later in life had either a change in occupation or a switch from full-time to part-time status. Finally, an examination of those career workers who changed jobs but not occupations and who remained working full time reveals that, as a whole, they resemble those who took bridge jobs rather than those who remained on their FTC job. We conclude that the vast majority of career workers who changed jobs later in life did in fact do so as part of a retirement transition.},

Results are based on 568 responses and provide evidence of changes in opinion over time by including propositions from earlier studies in 2000 (Fuller and Geide-Stevenson 2003) and 1992 (Alston, Kearl, and Vaughan 1992). Propositions focus on microeconomics, macroeconomics, distributional and international topics, as well as pedagogy. Results indicate a movement toward an overall higher level of consensus, mainly because of a drop in the incidence of no consensus. Especially in the area of distributional propositions, economists display an increased concern with income inequality and potential effects on growth. In the area of macroeconomics, current opinions are more similar to those of the 1992 survey than the 2000 survey. {\textcopyright} Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

An example of this phenomenon is the recent misuse of traditional measures of "work disability" in media reports which argue that nondiscrimination policy has not produced increases in these employment rates. The paper cites media reports with mistaken uses of standard measures and notes that such errors flourish in a political climate receptive to reversing the emphasis on inclusion in disability policy. However, standard measures of "work disability" confound individual and situational factors. Users who do not adequately understand the nonmedical dimensions of disability unwittingly interpret trends in traditional measures as ifthe only operative factor were individuals' impairments. In this paper, I present the logic by which opposite conclusions about the effects of nondiscrimination disability policy can be inferred from existing data as a result of this confounding.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Millions of Americans live in the US territories, but health outcomes and payments among Medicare beneficiaries in these territories are not well characterized. METHODS: Among Fee-for-Service Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older hospitalized between 1999 and 2012 for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure (HF), and pneumonia, we compared hospitalization rates, patient outcomes, and inpatient payments in the territories and states. RESULTS: Over 14 years, there were 4,350,813 unique beneficiaries in the territories and 402,902,615 in the states. Hospitalization rates for AMI, HF, and pneumonia declined overall and did not differ significantly. However, 30-day mortality rates were higher in the territories for all 3 conditions: in the most recent time period (2008-2012), the adjusted odds of 30-day mortality were 1.34 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.21-1.48], 1.24 (95{\%} CI, 1.12-1.37), and 1.85 (95{\%} CI, 1.71-2.00) for AMI, HF, and pneumonia, respectively; adjusted odds of 1-year mortality were also higher. In the most recent study period, inflation-adjusted Medicare in-patient payments, in 2012 dollars, were lower in the territories than the states, at {\$}9234 less (61{\%} lower than states), {\$}4479 less (50{\%} lower), and {\$}4403 less (39{\%} lower) for AMI, HF, and pneumonia hospitalizations, respectively (P{\textless}0.001 for all). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among Medicare Fee-for-Service beneficiaries, in 2008-2012 mortality rates were higher, or not significantly different, and hospital reimbursements were lower for patients hospitalized with AMI, HF, and pneumonia in the territories. Improvement of health care and policies in the territories is critical to ensure health equity for all Americans.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, The Author(s) 2018. Gender-based violence (GBV) is an umbrella term for any harm that is perpetrated against a person's will and that results from power inequalities based on gender roles. Most global estimates of GBV implicitly refer only to the experiences of cisgender, heterosexually identified women, which often comes at the exclusion of transgender and gender nonconforming (trans) populations. Those who perpetrate violence against trans populations often target gender nonconformity, gender expression or identity, and perceived sexual orientation and thus these forms of violence should be considered within broader discussions of GBV. Nascent epidemiologic research suggests a high burden of GBV among trans populations, with an estimated prevalence that ranges from 7{\%} to 89{\%} among trans populations and subpopulations. Further, 165 trans persons have been reported murdered in the United States between 2008 and 2016. GBV is associated with multiple poor health outcomes and has been broadly posited as a component of syndemics, a term used to describe an interaction of diseases with underlying social forces, concomitant with limited prevention and response programs. The interaction of social stigma, inadequate laws, and punitive policies as well as a lack of effective GBV programs limits access to and use of GBV prevention and response programs among trans populations. This commentary summarizes the current body of research on GBV among trans populations and highlights areas for future research, intervention, and policy.},

Transgender people are at elevated risk for nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal ideation compared to the general population. Transgender (trans) refers to a diverse group of people who experience incongruence between their gender identity and sex assigned at birth. The present study is guided by the minority stress model and the psychological mediation framework, which postulate that sexual minority groups experience elevated stress as a result of anti-minority prejudice, contributing to negative mental health outcomes. This study utilized these theories to investigate the role of internalized transnegativity—internalization of negative societal attitudes about one's trans identity—in the relationships of distal trans stress to suicidal ideation and NSSI. A U.S. national sample of trans adults (N = 237) completed a battery of online measures. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to compare models with mediation and moderation effects. Results suggested that internalized transnegativity acts as both a mediator and a moderator in the relationship between distal trans stress and suicidal ideation. Log likelihood comparisons suggested moderation models had the superior fit for these data. Results suggest that clinical interventions should directly target individuals' internalized transnegativity as well as societal-level transnegativity.},

Questionnaire data on retirement age and type of pension was gathered in 2000. Five distinct PF trajectories were created using latent growth mixture modelling. Mortality- and covariate-adjusted multinomial regression models were used to estimate multinomial Odds Ratios (mOR) on the association between retirement characteristics and PF trajectories. Results: A one-year increase in retirement age was associated with decreased likelihood of being classified in the ‘consistently low' (fully adjusted mOR = 0.82; 95{\%}CI = 0.70, 0.97; P = 0.007), ‘intermediate and declining' (mOR = 0.89; 95{\%}CI = 0.83, 0.96; P = 0.002), and ‘high and declining' (mOR = 0.92; 95{\%}CI = 0.87, 0.98; P = 0.006) trajectories, relative to the ‘intact' PF trajectory. Compared to old age pensioners, disability pensioners were more likely to be classified in the ‘consistently low' (mOR = 23.77; 95{\%} CI 2.13, 265.04; P = 0.010), ‘intermediate and declining' (mOR = 8.24; 95{\%}CI = 2.58, 26.35; P {\textless} 0.001), and ‘high and declining' (mOR = 2.71; 95{\%}CI = 1.17, 6.28; P = 0.020) PF trajectories, relative to the ‘intact' PF trajectory. Conclusions: Among executives and managers, older age at retirement was associated with better trajectories of PF in old age. Compared to old age pensioners, those transitioning into disability and early old age pensions were at risk of having consistently lower PF in old age.},

It establishes that employment effects of a minimum wage do not generally indicate welfare effects. It shows that researchers interested in welfare consequences should ask two questions. First, is the existing minimum wage binding? Second, do some firms that would be bound by a new minimum wage presently experience labor shortages? If the answers to these questions are no and yes, respectively, this article supports the conclusion that a higher minimum wage is welfare improving, regardless of its effect on the unemployment rate.},

abstract = {This paper reviews evidence indicating that, as it has been enforced so far, affirmative action has contributed negligibly to women's progress in the workplace. Affirmative action can be modelled as a tax on employers whose female employment growth falls below a certain rate. Clearly, if labor supply shifts result in female employment growth greater than the regulatory standard, the tax constraint will not be binding. As we shall see, this may help explain an affirmative action program that is generally ineffective for women, although it has been effective for minorities. Federal anti-bias policies in general, and the system of affirmative action goals in particular, have been accused of instituting employment quotas. This implies that as each employer attempts to scurry behind the alleged safety of the "right" numbers, each should come to look more like each other in the same labor market. This paper reviews evidence on the homogenization of the workplace predicted by the quota theory, as well as considering more direct evidence on whether affirmative action goals are really quotas in lambs' clothing. I shall also review the slim evidence on the most fundamental and controversial criticism of affirmative action: that rather than reducing discrimination against women and minorities, it has induced discrimination against white males. A new methodology employing direct productivity measures rather than the traditional but limited wage equation residuals proves useful in exploring this issue.},

abstract = {Although the medical profession strives for equal treatment of all patients, disparities in health care are prevalent. Cultural stereotypes may not be consciously endorsed, but their mere existence influences how information about an individual is processed and leads to unintended biases in decision-making, so called "implicit bias". All of society is susceptible to these biases, including physicians. Research suggests that implicit bias may contribute to health care disparities by shaping physician behavior and producing differences in medical treatment along the lines of race, ethnicity, gender or other characteristics. We review the origins of implicit bias, cite research documenting the existence of implicit bias among physicians, and describe studies that demonstrate implicit bias in clinical decision-making. We then present the bias-reducing strategies of consciously taking patients' perspectives and intentionally focusing on individual patients' information apart from their social group. We conclude that the contribution of implicit bias to health care disparities could decrease if all physicians acknowledged their susceptibility to it, and deliberately practiced perspective-taking and individuation when providing patient care. We further conclude that increasing the number of African American/Black physicians could reduce the impact of implicit bias on health care disparities because they exhibit significantly less implicit race bias.},

America's troubled history of lynchings and race riots is one topic increasingly addressed by commemorative projects. This article evaluates factors shaping efforts to imprint past racial violence into broader collective memory. Building on research on constraints imposed by actual pasts and environmental conditions, I argue that structural influences on collective memory, or mnemonic opportunity structures, powerfully affect the success of commemorative initiatives. I identify three major dimensions of mnemonic opportunity structures: (1) an environment's present-day commemorative capacity, a past incident's (2) ascribed significance, and (3) the moral valence of key characters at the time it occurred. Qualitative data from multiple case studies and 90 interviews, along with supplementary quantitative and qualitative comparative analyses (QCAs) of all recent projects marking segregation-era racial violence, illustrate the utility of the framework.},

abstract = {Researchers often test for pre-trends when using a research design that relies on a parallel trends assumption, yet typical estimation and inference does not account for this test. This paper analyzes the properties of conventional estimates conditional on having passed (i.e. not rejected) a pre-test for parallel pre-trends. I derive a formula for the bias in conventional treatment effects estimates after pre-testing, which generally differs from the unconditional bias when parallel trends is violated. Moreover, I prove that under homoskedasticity, the additional bias from pre-testing amplifies the bias in the treatment effects estimates from a monotone violation of parallel trends. Hence, pre-trends tests meant to mitigate bias in published work can actually exacerbate it. In addition, coverage rates of traditional confidence intervals can be above or below their nominal level conditional on passing the pre-test. Simulations based on a review of recent papers in leading economics journals suggest that substantial distortions from pre-testing are possible in practice. To address these issues, I develop a method of constructing corrected event-study plots that removes distortions from pre-testing or from model-selection on the basis of pre-trends. I illustrate the usefulness of these corrections in simulations and in an application to Dube et al. (2010)'s study of the minimum wage.},

abstract = {The often observed association between the size of the black population and the amount of social control imposed on blacks has been interpreted as consistent with one of three conceptually distinct perspectives: (1) the political threat hypothesis, (2) the economic threat hypothesis, and (3) the threat of black crime hypothesis. Although these three hypotheses advance differing conceptualizations of threat, adjudicating between them has proven difficult. The current study uses county-level data drawn from South Carolina's National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), race-specific voting data, and demographic data to investigate the validity of each of these racial threat hypotheses. Results from a pooled cross-sectional time-series analysis show that black-on-white crime has a substantive positive effect on black arrest levels. In contrast, no such effect is observed for black-on-black crime. These findings taken together furnish strong support for the threat of black crime hypothesis. The curvilinear relationship between the ratio of black-to-white votes cast in a general election and black arrest levels hypothesized by the political threat hypothesis does not hold for the data analyzed. Additionally, we find no empirical support for the economic threat hypothesis. The implications of these findings are discussed.

abstract = {This article presents the findings of a field experiment carried out in Madrid which aims to analyse gender and age discrimination in hiring in the labour market of Madrid.Aset of five pairs of fictitious man–woman curricula was sent in response to 1062 job offers in six occupations which were advertised on Internet over an eight-month period. It was quantified subsequently the extent to which the different firms contacted more or less the candidates of different sex, age and marital status. No discrimination is detected against women in terms of access to job interviews; however, discriminatory conduct is seen regarding the phenomenon of occupational gender segregation, in the sense that there is a continuance among employers of stereotyped views on the greater suitability of women for certain tasks. No evidence is found to indicate firms showing relative discrimination against married women with children in the first phase of hiring process. And a clear evidence of discrimination is obtained on the basis of age: firms show a substantial fall in interest over interviewing 38-year-old candidates (compared to those aged 24 or 28). This would imply that the tendency to discriminate against older workers may be high, and, what is more, it may start at a surprisingly young age.},

abstract = {Prior studies have provided evidence of discrimination between drivers and passengers in the context of ridehailing. This paper extends prior research by investigating passenger-to-passenger discriminatory attitudes in the context of ridesharing. We conducted a survey of 1110 Uber and Lyft users in the US using Mechanical Turk, 76.5{\%} of whom have used uberPOOL or Lyft Shared rides, and estimated two structural equation models. The first model examines the influence of one's demographic, social and economic characteristics on discriminatory attitudes toward fellow passengers in ridesharing, and how such influence varies by the targets of discrimination (i.e., race and class). The second model examines the influence of one's generic social dominance orientation on discriminatory attitudes in the ridesharing context. We find that discriminatory attitudes toward fellow passengers of differing class and race in the shared ride are positively correlated with respondents that are male or are women with children. A respondent's race does not have a significant effect on discriminatory attitudes, but white respondents that live in majority white counties are more likely to hold discriminatory attitudes with regard to race (no effect is observed regarding class preferences). The same is true of respondents that live in counties in which a larger share of the electorate voted for the Republican candidate in the 2016 presidential election. Conversely, higher-income respondents appear more likely to hold discriminatory attitudes regarding class, but no effect is observed regarding racial preferences. We also find that one's generic social dominance orientation strongly influences his/her discriminatory attitudes in ridesharing, supporting the claim that behavior in shared mobility platforms reflects long-standing social dominance attitudes. Further research is required to identify policy interventions that mitigate such attitudes in the context of ridesharing.},

Evidence suggests that simple statistical discrimination, {\&} not just taste discrimination, is partly responsible for race differences in starting wages. But, because women's average performance in the sample is higher than men's, simple statistical discrimination cannot explain the sex gap. In more complex models of statistical discrimination, worse information about a group can lower its average wage. Estimates of the quality of labor market information indicate that this may explain women's lower starting wages. 7 Tables, 31 References.},

The extent of this form of discrimination is supported by: 1. unemployment and underemployment figures, 2. evidence of direct employment discrimination, and 3. the focus of government-sponsored assessment, rehabilitation and training programs. Such employment discrimination against disabled persons is further reinforced by: 1. employer attitudes toward the disabled, 2. the incidence of pre-employment medical screenings, and 3. employer expectations regarding education, age, experience and appearance. Clearly, to minimize such discrimination, government policy needs to ensure the meaningful integration of disabled persons into the economic and social life of the community by eliminating physical and intellectual barriers to employment and by emphasizing and enforcing open-mindedness and tolerance in hiring practices.},

It focuses on the institutional structure of present-day cultural production and the media industry and on their geographical organization at the local and global levels. The cultural economy is a prime mover for globalization processes in the urban system, in which cultural production clusters act as local nodes in the global networks of the large media groups. The models frequently used to analyse the global city system will be supplemented and partially modified by an empirical analysis of the 'world media cities'. The analysis of the world media cities enables those locations to be identified, from which globalization in the spheres of culture and the media proceeds and is 'produced' in practical terms. Global city research has predominantly emphasized the role of advanced producer services-in contrast this article concludes that for the process of globalization the globally operating media firms are at least as influential as the global providers of corporate services, because they create a cultural market space of global dimensions, on the basis of which the specialized global service providers can ensure the practical management of global production and market networks.},

Why racial disparities in antiretroviral use exist is not completely understood. We examined whether racial concordance (patients and providers having the same race) affects the time of receipt of protease inhibitors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We analyzed data from a prospective, cohort study of a national probability sample of 1,241 adults receiving HIV care with linked data from 287 providers. We examined the association between patient-provider racial concordance and time from when the Food and Drug Administration approved the first protease inhibitor to the time when patients first received a protease inhibitor.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In our unadjusted model, white patients received protease inhibitors much earlier than African-American patients (median 277 days compared to 439 days; P {\textless} .0001). Adjusting for patient characteristics only, African-American patients with white providers received protease inhibitors significantly later than African-American patients with African-American providers (median 461 days vs. 342 days respectively; P {\textless} .001) and white patients with white providers (median 461 vs. 353 days respectively; P= .002).

During the same period of time employment rates for men with work limitations showed substantial declines in both absolute and relative terms. While the timing of these trends suggests that the expansion of DI was a major contributor to employment decline and raises questions about the targeting of disability benefits, studies using denied applicants suggest a more modest role for DI expansion. In order to reconcile these findings, we decompose total employment changes into population and employment changes for three categories: DI beneficiaries, denied applicants and non-applicants. Our results show that during the early 1990s, the growth in DI can fully explain the employment decline for men only under an extreme assumption about the employment potential of beneficiaries. For the period after the mid-1990s, we find little role for the DI program in explaining the continuing employment decline for men with work limitations.},

abstract = {Caste based quotas in hiring have existed in the public sector in India for decades. Recently there has been debate about introducing similar quotas in private sector jobs. This paper uses a correspondence study to determine the extent of caste based discrimination in the Indian private sector. On average low-caste applicants need to send 20{\%} more resumes than high-caste applicants to get the same callback. Differences in callback which favor high-caste applicants are particularly large when hiring is done by male recruiters or by Hindu recruiters. This finding provides evidence that differences in callback between high and low-caste applicants are not entirely due to statistical discrimination. High-caste applicants are also differentially favored by firms with a smaller scale of operations, while low-caste applicants are favored by firms with a larger scale of operations. This finding is consistent with taste-based theories of discrimination and with commitments made by large firms to hire actively from among low-caste groups. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Same-sex couples' marital surplus, their excess total income over that predicted by their work times and predicted wages, increases little as the duration of their relationship lengthens. When/ where same-sex marriage is legal, it rises sharply as duration increases. The availability of legal domestic partnership or civil union has no effect on the surplus. The likelihood of home ownership conditional on demographic characteristics also increases with partnerships' duration only when/where same-sex marriage is legal. These results, based on data from the American Community Survey 2013-17, support the notion that greater legal protection enhances partners' incentives to invest in their relationship.},

Health inequities point to the underlying causes of the disparities, many if not most of which sit largely outside of the typically constituted domain of "health". The literature reviewed for this synthesis document indicates that time and again health disparities are directly and indirectly associated with social, economic, cultural and political inequities; the end result of which is a disproportionate burden of ill health and social suffering upon the Aboriginal populations of Canada. In analyses of health disparities, it is as important to navigate the interstices between the person and the wider social and historical contexts as it is to pay attention to the individual effects of inequity. Research and policy must address the contemporary realities of Aboriginal health and well-being, including the individual and community based effects of health disparities and the direct and indirect sources of those disparities.},

It is found above all in attitudes of both races, but also in social relations, in intermarriage, in residential location, and, frequently, in legal barriers. It is also found in levels of economic accomplishment; that is, income, wages, prices paid, and credit extended. It is natural to suppose that economic analysis can cast light on the economic effects of racial discrimination. But the pervasiveness of the phenomenon must give us pause. Can a phenomenon manifest everywhere in the social world really be understood, even in only one aspect, by the tools of a single discipline? I want to explore here the scope and limits of ordinary economic analysis for understanding racial discrimination even in markets.},

What have been less well researched are the large spatial differences in the size of disability benefit rolls that have emerged in some countries over this period. The UK displays a distinct regional pattern where working-age men and women in the 'North' are considerably more likely to be claiming disability benefits than those in the 'South'. The USA has its own version of the north/south divide, with many southern states displaying disproportionately large disability benefit rolls. The paper describes these regional patterns and explores the existing economics literature on disability benefits in search of potential explanations for them.},

@techreport{Friedman2013,
abstract = {This is the first large-scale, paired-testing study to assess housing discrimination against same-sex couples in metropolitan rental markets via advertisements on the Internet. The research is based on 6,833 e-mail correspondence tests conducted in 50 metropolitan markets across the United States from June through October 2011. For each correspondence test, two e-mails were sent to the housing provider, each inquiring about the availability of the unit advertised on the Internet. The only difference between the two e-mails was the sexual orientation of the couple making the inquiry. Two sets of correspondence tests were conducted, one assessing the treatment of gay male couples relative to heterosexual couples and one assessing the treatment of lesbian couples relative to heterosexual couples. This methodology provides the first direct evidence of discriminatory treatment of same-sex couples compared with the treatment of heterosexual couples when searching for rental housing advertised on the Internet in the United States. The study finds that same-sex couples experience less favorable treatment than heterosexual couples in the online rental housing market. The primary form of adverse treatment is that same-sex couples receive significantly fewer responses to e-mail inquiries about advertised units than heterosexual couples. Study results in jurisdictions with state-level protections against housing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation unexpectedly show slightly more adverse treatment of same-sex couples than results in jurisdictions without such protections. This study provides an important initial observation of discrimination based on sexual orientation at the threshold stage of the rental transaction and is a point of departure for future research on housing discrimination against same-sex couples.},

Both treatments were outpatient, relatively brief, manual-guided, equal in intervention dose, and delivered by community drug treatment therapists. Adolescents and their parents were assessed at intake to treatment, randomly assigned to either MDFT or group therapy, and reassessed at six weeks after intake and at discharge. Results indicated that the family-based treatment (MDFT, an intervention that targets teen and parent functioning within and across multiple systems on a variety of risk and protective factors) was significantly more effective than peer group therapy in reducing risk and promoting protective processes in the individual, family, peer, and school domains, as well as in reducing substance use over the course of treatment. These results, which add to the body of previous findings about the clinical and cost effectiveness of MDFT, support the clinical effectiveness and dissemination potential of this family-based, multisystem and developmentally-oriented intervention.},

abstract = {Progress in science relies in part on generating hypotheses with existing observations and testing hypotheses with new observations. This distinction between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and analysis plan before observing the research outcomes—a process called preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A variety of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application, such as when the data are preexisting. Services are now available for preregistration across all disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the practice. Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing and will improve the credibility of research findings.},

Typically, two fake Curriculum Vitae (CVs) are sent to multiple job openings. The CVs are equivalent except for a mark identifying the disadvantaged. While it is straightforward to establish discrimination from minorities' lower response rates, it is often unclear what its source may be. Discrimination may result as much from employers' aversion toward a minority, as from perceptions that members have lower or more dispersed abilities that are unstandardizable in a CV. We refine existing methodologies to propose a wider-scope method capable of disentangling these three sources of discrimination and establish its face validity applying it to a correspondence study aimed at assessing labor market discrimination against ex-convicts in a local market.},

It translates into a lower willingness to accept and pay for an offer. Market simulations confirm the robustness of the findings.

In doing so it provides an overview of issues in estimation in empirical work relating to disability. Design/methodology/approach - This paper reviews the existing international evidence relating to the impact of disability on labour market outcomes. Findings - Regardless of country, data source or time period disability serves to reduce labour market prospects. Understanding the reasons for this requires consideration of issues such as separating discrimination from unobserved differences in productivity and preferences, the influence of heterogeneity within the disabled group and the dynamic effects of disability. Practical implications - The paper also reviews recent evidence concerning the labour market impact of significant changes in legislation affecting the disabled, particularly the introduction of the Americans with Disabilities Act in the USA. This evidence is particularly useful to policymakers. Originality/value - The paper provides a comprehensive review of the empirical evidence relating to the labour market impact of disability and the influence of recent changes in legislation.

abstract = {The analysis of data from experiments in economics routinely involves testing multiple null hypotheses simultaneously. These different null hypotheses arise naturally in this setting for at least three different reasons: when there are multiple outcomes of interest and it is desired to determine on which of these outcomes a treatment has an effect; when the effect of a treatment may be heterogeneous in that it varies across subgroups defined by observed characteristics and it is desired to determine for which of these subgroups a treatment has an effect; and finally when there are multiple treatments of interest and it is desired to determine which treatments have an effect relative to either the control or relative to each of the other treatments. In this paper, we provide a bootstrap-based procedure for testing these null hypotheses simultaneously using experimental data in which simple random sampling is used to assign treatment status to units. Using the general results in Romano and Wolf (Ann Stat 38:598–633, 2010), we show under weak assumptions that our procedure (1) asymptotically controls the familywise error rate—the probability of one or more false rejections—and (2) is asymptotically balanced in that the marginal probability of rejecting any true null hypothesis is approximately equal in large samples. Importantly, by incorporating information about dependence ignored in classical multiple testing procedures, such as the Bonferroni and Holm corrections, our procedure has much greater ability to detect truly false null hypotheses. In the presence of multiple treatments, we additionally show how to exploit logical restrictions across null hypotheses to further improve power. We illustrate our methodology by revisiting the study by Karlan and List (Am Econ Rev 97(5):1774–1793, 2007) of why people give to charitable causes.},

The scores assigned to the language related to ageist stereotypes are larger when responses are incentivized by rewarding participants for guessing how other respondents rated the language. These methods could potentially help enforce anti-discrimination laws by using job ads to predict or identify employers more likely to be engaging in age discrimination. Ian},

abstract = {Approximately 4{\%} of individuals in North America participate in consensually nonmonogamous (CNM) relationships, wherein all partners have agreed to additional sexual and/or emotional partnerships. The CNM relationships are stigmatized and viewed as less stable and satisfying than monogamous relationships, a perception that persists despite research evidence. In our study, we assess the legitimacy of this negative perception by using a self-determination theory (SDT) framework to explore how sexual motivation impacts relational and sexual satisfaction among CNM and monogamous participants in romantic relationships. A total of 348 CNM (n = 142) and monogamous participants (n = 206) were recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk. (2016). www.mturk.com) to complete a cross-sectional survey. Participants reported on their sexual motivations during their most recent sexual event, their level of sexual need fulfillment, and measures of sexual and relational satisfaction with their current (primary) partner. The CNM and monogamous participants reported similar reasons for engaging in sex, though CNM participants were significantly more likely to have sex for personal intrinsic motives. No differences in mean levels of relationship and sexual satisfaction were found between CNM and monogamous individuals. Participants who engaged in sex for more self-determined reasons reported increased relational and sexual satisfaction. This relationship was mediated by sexual need fulfillment; participants who reported more self-determined motives reported higher levels of need fulfillment and, in turn, greater relationship and sexual satisfaction. This study indicates that CNM and monogamous individuals report similar levels of satisfaction within their relationship(s) and that the mechanisms that affect relational and sexual satisfaction are similar for both CNM and monogamous individuals. Our research extends theoretical understandings of motivation within romantic relationships and suggests that SDT is a useful framework for considering the impact of sexual motivation on relational outcomes.},

abstract = {Social dominance theory (Sidanius {\&} Pratto, 1999) contends that institutional-level mechanisms exist that reinforce and perpetuate existing group-based inequalities, but very few such mechanisms have been empirically demonstrated. We propose that gendered wording (i.e., masculine- and feminine-themed words, such as those associated with gender stereotypes) may be a heretofore unacknowledged, institutional-level mechanism of inequality maintenance. Employing both archival and experimental analyses, the present research demonstrates that gendered wording commonly employed in job recruitment materials can maintain gender inequality in traditionally male-dominated occupations. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated the existence of subtle but systematic wording differences within a randomly sampled set of job advertisements. Results indicated that job advertisements for male-dominated areas employed greater masculine wording (i.e., words associated with male stereotypes, such as leader, competitive, dominant) than advertisements within female-dominated areas. No difference in the presence of feminine wording (i.e., words associated with female stereotypes, such as support, understand, interpersonal) emerged across male- and female-dominated areas. Next, the consequences of highly masculine wording were tested across 3 experimental studies. When job advertisements were constructed to include more masculine than feminine wording, participants perceived more men within these occupations (Study 3), and importantly, women found these jobs less appealing (Studies 4 and 5). Results confirmed that perceptions of belongingness (but not perceived skills) mediated the effect of gendered wording on job appeal (Study 5). The function of gendered wording in maintaining traditional gender divisions, implications for gender parity, and theoretical models of inequality are discussed.},

Based on interviews and participant-observation in New York City, we trace how entrepreneurial labor becomes intertwined with work identities in cultural industries both on and off the job. While workers are drawn to the autonomy, creativity and excitement that jobs in these media industries can provide, they have also come to accept as normal the high risks associated with this work. Diffused through media images, this normalization of risk serves as a model for how workers in other industries should behave under flexible employment conditions. Using interview data from within the fashion media and the dot-com world, we discuss eight forces that give rise to the phenomenon of entrepreneurial labor: the cultural quality of cool, creativity, autonomy, self-investment, compulsory networking, portfolio evaluations, international competition, and foreshortened careers. We also provide a model of what constitutes the hierarchy of ?good work? in cultural industries, and we conclude with implications of what entrepreneurial labor means for theories of work.},

Tribal governments that can negotiate gaming compacts with multiple state governments, because tribal lands span state borders, had more than twice the estimated probability (.77 versus .32) of operating an Indian casino in 1999. Tribal governments of reservations where contracts are adju- dicated in state courts, rather than tribal courts, have more than twice the estimated probability (.76 versus .34) of investing in an Indian casino, ceteris paribus. These findings suggest that states' political pressures and predictable judiciaries affect incentives to invest in casinos. This study contributes, more generally, to the empirical literature on the effects of institutions by providing new evidence that low-cost contracting is important for taking advantage of substantial investment opportunities.},

By exploiting the timing of implementation among different Spanish regions of a subsidy scheme implemented in Spain during the period 1990–2014, we employed a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the impact of the scheme on the probability of disability insurance (DI) beneficiaries of transiting to employment and on the propensity of individuals of entering the DI program. Our results show that the introduction of the subsidy scheme is in general ineffective at incentivizing transitions to employment, and in some cases it is associated with an increased propensity of transiting to DI. Furthermore, we show that an employment protection component incorporated into the subsidy scheme, consisting in the obligation for the employer to maintain the subsidized worker in employment, is associated with less transitions to permanent employment, more transitions to temporary employment and more transitions to DI, suggesting that these type of employment protection measures can have undesired effects for people with disabilities. {\textcopyright} 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Employing a logistic regression analysis, we find that social network usage, online antagonism, informal online social control, and a lack of online anonymity increase the likelihood of being targeted. Moreover, individuals living in the southern region of the United States are nearly three times as likely to be targeted by hate related to sexual orientation, whereas those living in rural areas are more than twice as likely to face such targeting.},

First, one set of participants engaged in a trait generation task which yielded a trait list for use in the second part of the study. Second, other participants sorted the set of traits into groups representing different types of elderly individuals. Trait groupings were analyzed with hierarchical cluster analysis. Results supported the hypothesis that older adults have more complex representations of aging than do middle-aged and young ones, and that middle-aged adults have more complex representations than do young ones. For example, middle-aged and elderly adults reported more stereotypes of the elderly than did young adults, and elderly adults reported more stereotypes than did middle-aged adults. Results also showed, as expected, that these differences in complexity exist against a background of general agreement about the nature of aging: trait lists produced by those in the three age groups were significantly correlated, and the stereotype sets of the three age groups included seven shared stereotypes. Results are interpreted in terms of their support for two alternative explanations of the complexity differences: ingroup/outgroup and developmental},

abstract = {This article focuses on racial and ethnic disparities in health care, describing both abso-lute differences and relative changes in access to care and the use of health services among whites, blacks, and Hispanics over the past two decades. Using data from a series of three nationally representative medical expenditure surveys, the authors present descriptive statistics on disparities in access and use between minorities and whites over time. They also use multivariate analyses to isolate the extent to which health insurance and income explain those disparities. The authors find that disparities increased between 1977 and 1996, particularly for Hispanic Americans. Results also show that approximately one half to three quarters of the disparities observed in 1996 would remain even if racial and ethnic disparities in income and health insurance coverage were eliminated. In 1984, the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services established a Task Force on Black and Minority Health to investigate the health problems of various racial and ethnic groups in the United States. In its report the following year, the task force noted considerable disparities between white Americans and other racial and ethnic groups with regard to},

I find an average effect of about .12 standard deviations for both math and reading achievement, an effect size on the low end of the range of prior estimates. These averages mask considerable heterogeneity, however, with effect size estimates ranging from just below zero to one-quarter of a standard deviation. The estimates on the upper end of the range presented here suggest that summer school may be a more cost-effective way of raising student achievement scores than class-size reductions. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Yet because of the methodological challenges related to the identification of a counterfactual when a single unit is treated, the causal effects of these policies on the growth of the industry, or specifically on employment, are seldom identified. We adopt a Synthetic Control Method (SCM) approach to analyze the long-term impact on employment of the Tourism Development Policy (TDP) implemented by the Argentinean province of Salta. We find an 11 percent average annual impact over 10 years on employment in the hospitality sector, which translated in an accumulated impact of 1376 formal jobs in the tourism value-chain. We also find that this growth did not happen at the expenses of other industries and that TDP generated positive inter-industry employment spillovers/externalities. For each job created in the tourism value-chain, an additional job was created in the rest of the provincial economy, which resulted in a total creation of 2750 formal jobs. Our results are robust across a series of placebo tests and sensitivity checks and are consistent among alternative synthetic control units.},

Findings are discussed in light of the joint role that ethnic identity and perceived bias have in relationship to developmental outcomes in Native American adolescents.},

We hypothesize two clusters of outgroups, one perceived as incompetent but warm (resulting in paternalistic prejudice) and one perceived as competent but not warm (resulting in envious prejudice). Perceived group status predicts perceived competence, and perceived competition predicts perceived (lack of) warmth. Two preliminary surveys support these hypotheses for 17 outgroups. In-depth analyses of prejudice toward particular outgroups support ambivalent prejudice: Paternalistic prejudice toward traditional women, as well as envious prejudice toward career women, results in ambivalent sexism (Glick{\&}Fiske, 1996). Envious prejudice toward Asians results in perceived com- petence but perceived lack of social skills. Ambivalent content reflects systematic principles. In},

Along these two key dimensions, we find that female officers improved police quality. Crime victimization data reveal that as female representation increases among officers in an area, violent crimes against women in that area, and especially DV, are reported to the police at significantly higher rates. There are no such effects for violent crimes against men or from increases in the female share of civilian police employees. Furthermore, increases in female officer shares are followed by significant declines in rates of intimate partner homicide and non-fatal domestic abuse. These effects are all consistent between fixed effects models with controls for economic and policy variables and models that focus exclusively on increases in female police employment driven by externally imposed affirmative action plans following litigation for employment discrimination.},

But how much demand exists for older workers? This paper reports on a field experiment to determine hiring conditions for older women in entry-level jobs in two cities. A younger worker is more than 40 percent more likely to be offered an interview than is an older worker. No evidence is found to support taste-based discrimination as a reason for this differential, and some suggestive evidence is found to support statistical discrimination.},

abstract = {The Social Security Amendments of 1983 reduced the generosity of Social Security retired worker benefits in the U.S. by increasing the program's full retirement age from 65 to 67 and increasing the penalty for claiming benefits at the early retirement age of 62. These changes were phased in gradually, so that individuals born in or before 1937 were unaffected and those born in 1960 or later were fully affected. No corresponding changes were made to the program's disabled worker benefits, and thus the relative generosity of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits increased. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the Amendments on SSDI enrollment by exploiting variation across birth cohorts in the policy-induced reduction in the present value of retired worker benefits. Our findings indicate that the Amendments significantly increased SSDI enrollment since 1983, with an additional 0.6{\%} of men and 0.9{\%} of women between the ages of 45 and 64 receiving SSDI benefits in 2005 as a result of the changes. Our results further indicate that these effects will continue to increase during the next two decades, as those fully exposed to the reduction in retirement benefit generosity reach their fifties and early sixties. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The chapter presents a survey and exposition of the development of the earnings function as an empirical tool for the analysis of the determinants of wage rates. Generically, the term “earnings function” has come to mean any regression of individual wage rates or earnings on a vector of personal, market, and environmental variables thought to influence the wage. The premier application is to the study of the effects of investment in schooling and on-the-job training on the level, pattern, and interpersonal distribution of life cycle earnings associated with the pioneering work on human capital by several mentioned scholars. The chapter is devoted to the theoretical and empirical development of the human capital earnings function during the past 25 years. The chapter surveys the empirical estimates of the rate of return to education and the pattern of life cycle earnings. The chapter discusses the derivation of human capital earnings functions under the assumption of homogenous human capital and introduces the model of heterogeneous human capital described. The chapter considers theoretical and econometric issues, which arise when there is inequality of opportunity and ability and closes with a discussion of empirical findings concerning ability bias. The chapter also describes some recent literature on several topics such as signalling, implicit contracts, and specific human capital, which extend or modify certain aspects of the human capital model.},

abstract = {Marketers who want to protect their brand's share or grow it need to know who to reach and nudge with advertising. This paper uses continuous household panel data for 55 leading, advertised brands in 12 cpg categories to quantify their target market over different time frames and conditions (market type, brand size and dynamism). Results demonstrate that the customer base (brand penetration) must swell dramatically over time to maintain, let alone grow, market share. For stable brands, penetration typically doubles from its level in one quarter to a year, then again from one year to five years as brands continue to attract lighter buyers who underpin long run sales. Over five years, over a third of brand buyers are so light that they buy the brand just once, but such buyers are vital to sales and critical to growth. As well as quantifying the five-year target audience for brands across these conditions, we test the predictive accuracy of the NBD-Dirichlet as a benchmark. The implications for advertising and media strategy are detailed. The long-term lessons for targeting become clear – unless brands “target the market”, they have adopted a counter growth strategy.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine whether name and accent cues that the caller is Black shape physician offices' responses to telephone-based requests for well-child visits. METHOD AND DATA: In this pilot study, we employed a quasi-experimental audit design and examined a stratified national sample of pediatric and family practice offices. Our final data include information from 205 audits (410 completed phone calls). Qualitative data were blind-coded into binary variables. Our case-control comparisons using McNemar's tests focused on acceptance of patients, withholding information, shaping conversations, and misattributions. FINDINGS: Compared to the control group, "Black" auditors were less likely to be told an office was accepting new patients and were more likely to experience both withholding behaviors and misattributions about public insurance. The strength of associations varied according to whether the cue was based on name or accent. Additionally, the likelihood and ways office personnel communicated that they were not accepting patients varied by region. CONCLUSIONS: Linguistic profiling over the telephone is an aspect of structural racism that should be further studied and perhaps integrated into efforts to promote equitable access to care. Future research should look reactions to both name and accent, taking practice characteristics and regional differences into consideration.},

With that proclamation, Congress enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).' The ADA's intent is clear, but the extent of its protection has been an object of confusion among employers, and a subject of scrutiny by the federal courts. What makes these estimated 43,000,000 Americans "disabled" within the meaning of the ADA? In defining "disability" under the ADA, Congress turned to the definition of what it means to be handicapped under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Rehabilitation Act). Under the Rehabilitation Act, handicap means "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major.., life activities" of the individual, "a record of such an impairment," or "being regarded as having such animpairment. ' " Such reliance offered comfort to disability rights advocates and congressional supporters of the ADA, who were confident that the same individuals who had been covered under the existing federal anti-discrimination protections would be covered under the ADA. This confidence, however, was short-lived: For the past ten years, challenges to the ADA's coverage have led to judicial parsing of every term in the definition of disability, and the subsequent failure to protect individuals with a wide range of impairments from discrimination.},

Methods: We obtained data from self-administered questionnaires completed in 2009 or 2010 by a subsample (n=202; average age=56.91 years; age range=44-75 years) of participants in the University of California, Los Angeles component of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, one of the largest and longestrunning natural-history studies of HIV/AIDS in the United States. Results: Both sexual minority stress (perceived gay-related stigma, excessive HIV bereavements) and aging-related stress (independence and fiscal concerns) appeared to have been detrimental to mental health. Sense of mastery partially mediated these associations. Being legally married was significantly protective net of all covariates, including having a domestic partner but not being married. Education, HIV status, and race/ethnicity had no significant effects. Conclusions: Sexual minority and aging-related stress significantly affected the emotional lives of these men. Personal sense of mastery may help to sustain them as they age. We observed specific mental health benefits of samesex legal marriage.},

abstract = {THE REGRESSION DISCONTINUITY (RD) data design is a quasi-experimental design with the defining characteristic that the probability of receiving treatment changes discontinuously as a function of one or more underlying variables. This data design arises frequently in economic and other applications but is only infrequently exploited as a source of identifying information in evaluating effects of a treatment. In the first application and discussion of the RD method, Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960) study the effect of student scholarships on career aspirations, using the fact that awards are only made if a test score exceeds a threshold. More recently, Van der Klaauw (1997) estimates the effect of financial aid offers on students' decisions to attend a particular college, taking into account administrative rules that set the aid amount partly on the basis of a discontinuous function of the students' grade point average and SAT score. Angrist and Lavy (1999) estimate the effect of class size on student test scores, taking advantage of a rule stipulating that another classroom be added when the average class size exceeds a threshold level. Finally, Black (1999) uses an RD approach to estimate parents' willingness to pay for higher quality schools by comparing housing prices near geographic school attendance boundaries. Regression discontinuity methods have potentially broad applicability in economic research, because geographic boundaries or rules governing programs often create discontinuities in the treatment assignment mechanism that can be exploited under the method. Although there have been several discussions and applications of RD methods in the literature, important questions still remain concerning sources of identification and ways of estimating treatment effects under minimal parametric restrictions. Here, we show that identifying conditions invoked in previous applications of RD methods are often overly strong and that treatment effects can be nonparametrically identified under an RD design by a weak functional form restriction. The restriction is unusual in that it requires imposing continuity assumptions in order to take advantage of the known discontinuity in the treatment assignment mechanism. We also propose a way of nonparametrically estimating treatment effects and offer an interpretation of the Wald estimator as an RD estimator.},

We also explain challenges in the design and implementation of these studies and how they can be addressed. Finally, we suggest avenues for future research and how future studies can contribute to reduce hiring discrimination.},

We highlight key gaps in the literature and ripe opportunities for future field work. Section 1 reviews the various experimental methods that have been employed to measure the prevalence of discrimination, most notably audit and correspondence studies; it also describes several other measurement tools commonly used in lab-based work that deserve greater consideration in field research. Section 2 provides an overview of the literature on the costs of being stereotyped or discriminated against, with a focus on self-expectancy effects and self-fulfilling prophecies; section 2 also discusses the thin field-based literature on the consequences of limited diversity in organizations and groups. The final section of the paper, Section 3, reviews the evidence for policies and interventions aimed at weakening discrimination, covering role model and intergroup contact effects, as well as socio-cognitive and technological de-biasing strategies.},

In typical social science practice, this decision often involves consideration of whether to send single or multiple auditors to test for discrimination at a site that represents the unit of analysis, such as employers, landlords, or schools. In this chapter, we provide tools for researchers considering the statistical and substantive implications of this decision. For the former, we show how sample size and statistical efficiency questions hinge in large part on the expected concordance of outcomes when testers are sent to the same unit or site. For the latter, we encourage researchers to think carefully about what is gained and lost via matched and non-matched designs, particularly regarding the finite nature of certain populations, resource constraints, and the likelihood of detection in the field. For both approaches, we make recommendations for the appropriate statistical analysis in light of the given design and direct readers to software and code that may be helpful in informing design choices. 2},

The usual solution is to calculate cluster-robust standard errors that permit heteroskedasticity and within-cluster error correlation, but presume that the number of clusters is large. Standard asymptotic tests can over-reject, however, with few (five to thirty) clusters. We investigate inference using cluster bootstrap-t procedures that provide asymptotic refinement. These procedures are evaluated using Monte Carlos, including the example of Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004). Rejection rates of 10{\%} using standard methods can be reduced to the nominal size of 5{\%} using our methods. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

We find landlords who are sent a PSA are more likely to respond to black clients one day and one week after treatment, though the effect appears to dissipate quickly.},

There is reason for skepticism of such surveys because people are not confronted with the tax costs of such policies when they are asked whether they support them. This paper uses contingent valuation (CV), a method frequently used to estimate people's willingness to pay (WTP) for goods or services not transacted in markets, applied to unique survey data from New York State to estimate the willingness to pay to reduce childhood obesity. The willingness to pay data correlate in predictable ways with respondent characteristics. The mean WTP for a 50{\%} reduction in childhood obesity is {\$}46.41 (95{\%} CI: {\$}33.45, {\$}59.15), which implies a total WTP by New York State residents of {\$}690.6 million (95{\%} CI: {\$}497.7, {\$}880.15), which is less than that implied by previous surveys that did not use CV methods but greater than current spending on policies to reduce childhood obesity and greater than the estimated savings in external costs. The findings provide policymakers with useful information about taxpayers' support for, and preferred budget for, anti-obesity policies. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Abadie2017,
abstract = {In empirical work in economics it is common to report standard errors that account for clustering of units. Typically, the motivation given for the clustering adjustments is that unobserved components in outcomes for units within clusters are correlated. However, because correlation may occur across more than one dimension, this motivation makes it difficult to justify why researchers use clustering in some dimensions, such as geographic, but not others, such as age cohorts or gender. It also makes it difficult to explain why one should not cluster with data from a randomized experiment. In this paper, we argue that clustering is in essence a design problem, either a sampling design or an experimental design issue. It is a sampling design issue if sampling follows a two stage process where in the first stage, a subset of clusters were sampled randomly from a population of clusters, while in the second stage, units were sampled randomly from the sampled clusters. In this case the clustering adjustment is justified by the fact that there are clusters in the population that we do not see in the sample. Clustering is an experimental design issue if the assignment is correlated within the clusters. We take the view that this second perspective best fits the typical setting in economics where clustering adjustments are used. This perspective allows us to shed new light on three questions: (i) when should one adjust the standard errors for clustering, (ii) when is the conventional adjustment for clustering appropriate, and (iii) when does the conventional adjustment of the standard errors matter.},

abstract = {Germany is currently experiencing a high influx of Muslim migrants. From a policy perspective, integration of migrants into the labor market is crucial. Hence, a field experiment was conducted that examined the employment chances of females with backgrounds of migration from Muslim countries, and especially of those wearing headscarves. It focused on Turkish migrants, who have constituted a large demographic group in Germany since the 1970s. In the field experiment presented here, job applications for three fictitious female characters with identical qualifications were sent out in response to job advertisements: one applicant had a German name, one a Turkish name, and one had a Turkish name and was wearing a headscarf in the photograph included in the application material. Germany was the ideal location for the experiment as job seekers typically attach their picture to their r{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}}. High levels of discrimination were found particularly against the migrant wearing a headscarf.},

We characterize the risk and relative performance of regularized estimators as a function of the data-generating process and show that data-driven choices of regularization parameters yield estimators with risk uniformly close to the risk attained under the optimal (unfeasible) choice of regularization parameters.

@article{Beck2013,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to explore the degree to which there have been changes during the recession in the behaviour of employers with regards to their employment of older workers. The paper aims to show that there has been substantial change since the last recession and that there are, potentially, significant developments still occurring. A small group of employers from a range of sectors were interviewed twice, once at the outset of the (first) recession and once towards its end. The situation for older workers in employment is better than in previous recessions, mainly because employers are less likely to resort to redundancies for workers of all ages. Instead, a range of flexible working options are being utilised, including flexible retirement and adjustments to work processes. In the main the flexibility was instituted and controlled by the organisations. Employers are looking for alternative strategies to deal with a shift in control over the retirement process as a result of the abolishment of the default retirement age. The research was undertaken with a small sample, which has implications for the generalizability of the results. Although it would be difficult to further investigate the developments of employer behaviour during the recession, the long-term implications and the effects of the recession, in particular on older workers, are yet to emerge. The paper shows a new development in dealing with older workers during a recession. {\textcopyright} 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

Results indicate that older workers are generally seen by younger workers as more uncomfortable with new technology, less flexible and more cautious on the job, and more loyal (and having fewer absences) to the organization than younger workers. As compared to younger American workers, younger Thai workers agree more with negative stereotype items that older workers make more mental mistakes, are slower to adapt to new technology, are more fearful of technology, and are less flexible at work. But they also agree more with positive stereotype items that older workers are absent less, have a better attitude toward work, and have a higher level of commitment to the organization than younger workers. In terms of their communication, younger Thai workers perceive both other younger Thai workers and older Thai workers as exhibiting more avoidant communication than their counterparts from the USA. The younger Thai workers also perceive members of their own age in-group as communicating in a more nonaccommodating manner than younger American workers. Implications for the aging process across cultures and the workplace are discussed.},

abstract = {The publishing industry shows marked evidence of both gender and racial discrimination. A rational explanation for this difference in treatment of both female and Black authors might relate to the taste-based preferences of book consumers, who might be less willing to pay for books by such authors. We ran a randomized experiment to test for the presence of discriminatory preferences by consumers based on authors' race, gender and/or age. We collected ratings of 25,201 book surveys across 9,072 subjects on Amazon's Mechanical Turk, making this study the largest experimental study of the book market to date. Subjects were presented with mocked-up book covers and descriptions from each of 14 fiction and non-fiction genres, with one of three possible titles per book randomly assigned. Using author names and photographs, we signaled authors' race, gender, and age and randomly assigned these combinations to each book presented to our subjects. We then asked subjects to rate their interest in purchasing the book, their evaluation of the author's credentials, and the amount they were willing to pay for the book. The experimental design of this study strived to eliminate the potential for proxy-based discrimination by providing book descriptions that detailed the authors' relevant professional experience. The large sample allowed for exploration of various types of taste-based discrimination observed in the literature, including discrimination against particular groups, homophily, and pro-social behavior. Overall, book consumers showed a willingness to pay approximately {\$}0.50 or 3.5{\%} more on average for books by Black authors and little, if any, practically meaningful discrimination based on age or gender. In other words, our study finds no and even contrary evidence of taste-based preferences by consumers that would rationalize the historic discriminatory treatment of Black or of female authors by publishers nor of discrimination based on an author's age.},

We find significant increases in the frequency and intensity of alcohol consumption combined with a significant decrease in moderate physical activities as a response to partner's retirement. In line with the existing literature, we find that own retirement has significant positive effects on engaging in moderate and vigorous physical activities but also leads to a significant increase in the frequency of alcohol intake. Overall, subjective health is negatively affected by spousal retirement and positively by own retirement.},

The gap in lethal use-of-force between places with and without protests widens over these subsequent years and is most prominent when protests are large or frequent. This result holds for alternative specifications, estimators, police homicide datasets, and population screens; however, it does not hold if lethal use-of-force is normalized by violent crime or arrests. Protests also influence local police agencies, which may explain the reduction. Agencies with local protests become more likely to obtain body-cameras, expand community policing, receive a larger operating budget, and reduce the number of property crime-related arrests, but forego some black officer employment and college education requirements.

abstract = {Sexual minority populations are exposed to more forms of distress than heterosexual individuals, thereby increasing the risk of suicidal behavior. It therefore seems surprising that suicidal behavior in sexual minorities is not sufficiently addressed in the nursing literature.The aim of this review was to integrate evidence-based knowledge and experiences related to suicide in sexual minorities into the nursing literature. This study has been conducted according to PRISMA guidelines, which contains a basic systematic screening process. Fourteen articles met the research criteria. The evaluation encompassed 4 themes: 1) Suicide attempts; 2) Thoughts of suicide; 3) Suicide attempts and completed suicide; 4) Suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts. Most studies focused on the dimensions of attempted suicide. The key finding was that young people in sexual minority groups exhibit more suicidal ideation, more suicide attempts and are more at risk of completed suicide than heterosexual individuals. Family-centered care for young people can therefore be one of the basic principles of nursing practice. Nurses can routinely ask adolescents about their sexual orientation and identity to provide appropriate assessment and care. Additionally, nurses can use educational, counseling, case manager and therapist roles to avoid negative experiences such as homophobia, stigmatization and the discrimination of sexual minorities.},

abstract = {Do transportation costs constrain job search in urban low wage labor markets? I test this question by providing transit subsidies to randomly selected clients of a non-profit employment agency. The subsidies generate a large, short-run increase in search intensity for a transit subsidy group relative to a control group receiving standard job search services but no transit subsidy. In the first two weeks, individuals assigned to the transit subsidy group apply and interview for 19{\%} more jobs than those not receiving subsidies. The subsidies generate the greatest increase in search intensity for individuals living far from employment opportunities. Some suggestive evidence indicates that greater search intensity translates into shorter unemployment durations. These results provide experimental evidence in support of the theory that search costs over space can depress job search intensity, contributing to persistent urban poverty in neighborhoods far from job opportunities. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Experimental political science has changed. In two short decades, it evolved from an emergent method to an accepted method to a primary method. The challenge now is to ensure that experimentalists design sound studies and implement them in ways that illuminate cause and effect. Ethical boundaries must also be respected, results interpreted in a transparent manner, and data and research materials must be shared to ensure others can build on what has been learned. This book explores the application of new designs; the introduction of novel data sources, measurement approaches, and statistical methods; the use of experiments in more substantive domains; and discipline-wide discussions about the robustness, generalizability, and ethics of experiments in political science. By exploring these novel opportunities while also highlighting the concomitant challenges, this volume enables scholars and practitioners to conduct high-quality experiments that will make key contributions to knowledge.},

@article{Bottmer2021,
abstract = {Since their introduction in Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003), Synthetic Control (SC) methods have quickly become one of the leading methods for estimating causal effects in observational studies with panel data. Formal discussions often motivate SC methods by the assumption that the potential outcomes were generated by a factor model. Here we study SC methods from a design-based perspective, assuming a model for the selection of the treated unit(s), e.g., random selection as guaranteed in a randomized experiment. We show that SC methods offer benefits even in settings with randomized assignment, and that the design perspective offers new insights into SC methods for observational data. A first insight is that the standard SC estimator is not unbiased under random assignment. We propose a simple modification of the SC estimator that guarantees unbiasedness in this setting and derive its exact, randomization-based, finite sample variance. We also propose an unbiased estimator for this variance. We show in settings with real data that under random assignment this Modified Unbiased Synthetic Control (MUSC) estimator can have a root mean-squared error (RMSE) that is substantially lower than that of the difference-in-means estimator. We show that such an improvement is weakly guaranteed if the treated period is similar to the other periods, for example, if the treated period was randomly selected. The improvement is most likely to be substantial if the number of pre-treatment periods is large relative to the number of control units.},

abstract = {Reductions in the implicit taxation of Social Security benefits from reducing or eliminating the Retirement Earnings Test (RET) are an appealing – and in many cases successful – means of encouraging labor supply of older individuals receiving benefits. The downside, however, is that the same policy reforms can encourage earlier claiming of Social Security benefits, which permanently lowers benefits paid in the future. Depending on the magnitude of the effects on earnings and how households or individuals adjust their consumption and savings decisions, the net effect can be lower incomes at much older ages well beyond when people have retired. We explore the consequences of the 2000 reforms eliminating the RET from the Full Retirement Age to age 69 for the longer-run evolution of income, focusing in particular on the incidence of low income among older women, who are more likely to have become dependent mainly on income from their Social Security benefits. We find that the elimination of the RET increased the likelihood of having low incomes among women in their mid-70s and older – ages at which the lower benefits, in the long run, from claiming earlier outweigh possibly higher income in the period when women or their husbands increased their labor supply.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to assess the role of race/ethnicity and prior prison sentences on employment opportunities. Secondarily, we compare the impact of applying for jobs (in-person and online), and the role of education in securing employment. This work was conducted in a large southwestern city (Phoenix AZ) with high rates of imprisonment for blacks and Hispanics. Methods: First, an audit test involving matched pairs of males within race/ethnicity categories (black, Hispanic, white) who applied for jobs in-person was conducted. More than 500 jobs were applied for by the audit testers. Second, a correspondence test was conducted using three pairs of r{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}}s matched within race/ethnicity. In the correspondence test, over 3,000 jobs were applied for online. Each test used random assignment. Because of its importance for entry level employment, a separate analysis of food service jobs applied for online was conducted. Results: Both sets of analyses were completed using cross-classified random effects (CCRE) models. Contrary to expectations, neither race/ethnicity nor prior prison record affected outcomes in the online application process. In contrast, both race/ethnicity and prison record had significant effects in the in-person audit analysis. The effect of a prison record was particularly strong for blacks. Conclusions: Race/ethnicity and prior prison sentence remain important impediments to success in gaining employment. These results are particularly strong for in-person job applications and are somewhat smaller for online job applications.},

abstract = {Background: Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) individuals experience serious mental health disparities and treatment inequities. Counsellor education has been identified as both a contributing factor to these problems as well as an ameliorating mechanism to address these inequalities.Aim: The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the impact of an LGBT-affirmative counselling course.Method: A total of 23 students enrolled in a graduate LGBT counselling course were administered the Sexual Orientation Counselor Competency Scale (SOCCS, Bidell, 2005) and the Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Affirmative Counseling Self-Efficacy Inventory (LGB-CSI, Dillon {\&} Worthington, 2003) pre- and post-course. In addition, a comparison group of 23 matched counselling students was obtained from an existing data source in order to make further assessments of the course's effectiveness. Those in the comparison group were not enrolled in the LGBT course, but were administered the SOCCS at analogous time intervals.Results: After completing the LGBT course, enrolled students demonstrated significant improvements regarding their sexual orientation counsellor competency and self-efficacy. In addition, these students showed significant gains in SOCCS scores versus those in the comparison group.Implications: Results from this study show the positive effect a full-credit LGBT psychotherapy course can have on graduate counselling students' sexual orientation counsellor competency and self-efficacy. The findings also indicate that such a course can significantly impact counselling skills, a facet of LGBT cultural competency found to be the most attenuated. Findings are discussed in conjunction with LGBT-affirmative counsellor training and clinical practice.},

It describes changes in racial attitudes over time, the persistence of negative racial stereotypes and the ways in which negative beliefs were incorporated into societal policies and institutions. It then reviews the available scientific evidence that suggests that racism can adversely affect mental health status in at least three ways. First, racism in societal institutions can lead to truncated socioeconomic mobility, differential access to desirable resources, and poor living conditions that can adversely affect mental health. Second, experiences of discrimination can induce physiological and psychological reactions that can lead to adverse changes in mental health status. Third, in race-conscious societies, the acceptance of negative cultural stereotypes can lead to unfavorable self-evaluations that have deleterious effects on psychological well-being.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Drawing on minority stress perspectives, we investigated the therapy experiences of individuals in consensually nonmonogamous (CNM) relationships., METHOD: We recruited a community sample of 249 individuals engaged in CNM relationships across the U.S. and Canada. Confirmatory factor analysis structural equation modeling was used to analyze client perceptions of therapist practices in a number of exemplary practices (affirming of CNM) or inappropriate practices (biased, inadequate, or not affirming of CNM), and their associations with evaluations of therapy. Open-end responses about what clients found very helpful and very unhelpful were also analyzed., RESULTS: Exemplary and inappropriate practices constituted separate but related patterns of therapist conduct. As expected, perceptions of exemplary and inappropriate practices predicted therapist helpfulness ratings and whether participants prematurely terminated their therapeutic relationships. Qualitative results point toward the importance of having/pursuing knowledge about CNM and using affirming, nonjudgmental practices., CONCLUSIONS: Therapists are positioned to either combat or perpetuate the minority stress faced by individuals engaged in CNM. The results of this study highlight the need for additional research, training, and guidelines regarding CNM clients and their therapy experiences.

A legislative bargaining model with endogenous grants documents a positive correlation between grant receipts and preferences for public goods; this correlation has likely biased existing work against measuring crowd-out. To correctfor such endogeneity, the model motivates instruments based on the political power of state congressional delegations. Ex- ploiting this exogenous variation in grants, the instrumental variables estimator reports crowd-out that is statistically and economically significant. This endogene- ity may explain the flypaper effect, a nonequivalence between grant receipts and private income. (JEL D70, H40, H77)},

abstract = {Designing culturally sensitive personalized interventions is essential to sustain patients' involvement in their treatment and encourage patients to take an active role in their own health and health care. We consider patient activation and empowerment as a cyclical process defined through patient accumulation of knowledge, confidence, and self-determination for their own health and health care. We propose a patient-centered, multilevel activation and empowerment framework (individual-, health care professional-, community-, and health care delivery system-level) to inform the development of culturally informed personalized patient activation and empowerment (P-PAE) interventions to improve population health and reduce racial and ethnic disparities. We discuss relevant Affordable Care Act payment and delivery policy reforms and how they affect patient activation and empowerment. Such policies include Accountable Care Organizations and value-based purchasing, patient-centered medical homes, and the community health benefit. Challenges and possible solutions to implementing the P-PAE are discussed. Comprehensive and longitudinal data sets with consistent P-PAE measures are needed to conduct comparative effectiveness analyses to evaluate the optimal P-PAE model. We believe the P-PAE model is timely and sustainable and will be critical to engaging patients in their treatment, developing patients' abilities to manage their health, helping patients express concerns and preferences regarding treatment, empowering patients to ask questions about treatment options, and building up strategic patient-provider partnerships through shared decision making.},

The research used administrative data to estimate the effect of labor market conditions, as measured by the unemployment rate, on the number of SSDI applications, the number and composition of initial allowances and denials, and the timing of applications relative to disability onset. The authors analyzed the period of the Great Recession, and compare this period with business cycle effects over the past two decades, from 1992 through 2012. The analysis isolates the quantity and composition of applicants who are induced to apply for SSDI benefits when labor market opportunities decline, and therefore provides important new evidence about the group for whom SSDI application is a substitute for labor force participation, and their impact on the SSDI program. },

@article{Kline2014,
abstract = {We study the long-run effects of one of the most ambitious regional development programs in U.S. history: the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Using as controls authorities that were proposed but never approved by Congress, we find that the TVA led to large gains in agricultural employment that were eventually reversed when the program's subsidies ended. Gains in manufacturing employment, by contrast, continued to intensify well after federal transfers had lapsed—a pattern consistent with the presence of agglomeration economies in manufacturing. Because manufacturing paid higher wages than agriculture, this shift raised aggregate income in the TVA region for an extended period of time. Economists have long cautioned that the local gains created by place-based policies may be offset by losses elsewhere. We develop a structured approach to assessing the TVA's aggregate consequences that is applicable to other place-based policies. In our model, the TVA affects the national economy both directly through infrastructure improvements and indirectly through agglomeration economies. The model's estimates suggest that the TVA's direct investments yielded a significant increase in national manufacturing productivity, with benefits exceeding the program's costs. However, the program's indirect effects appear to have been limited: agglomeration gains in the TVA region were offset by losses in the rest of the country. Spillovers in manufacturing appear to be the rare example of a localized market failure that cancels out in the aggregate.},

The remarkable growth in online search has substantially lowered the cost of information acquisition. Despite this, there is little evidence concerning the extent to which this has altered the search process and raised overall matching efficiency. To address this issue, we analyze the expansion of the website "Craigslist", which allows users to post job ads and apartment and housing rental ads at virtually no cost. Exploiting the sharp geographic and temporal variation in the availability of online search, induced by Craigslist, we produce three key findings: Craigslist significantly lowered classified job advertisements in newspapers, caused a significant reduction in the apartment and housing rental vacancy rate, and had no effect on the unemployment rate.},

abstract = {A number of untreated or inadequately treated psychiatric illnesses often demonstrate syndrome progression manifested by either increasing frequency, severity, or spontaneity of episodes. Behavioral sensitization to psychomotor stimulants (and its cross sensitization to stress) and electrophysiological kindling provide two very different models for conceptualizing physiological and behavioral abnormalities that progress in severity in response to the same inducing stimulation over time. These models are highly indirect, and the behaviors induced and specific pharmacologic interventions do not directly parallel those in many of these psychiatric syndromes. Nonetheless, these preclinical models help us conceptualize potential mechanisms involved in syndrome progression based on experience- dependent modifications of the genome at the level of transcriptional regulation. In both preclinical models, agents that are effective in the earlier developmental phase of sensitization or kindling are not necessarily effective in amelioration of the full-blown syndromes, and vice versa. Thus these models also suggest a variety of intervention principles that can be directly tested in the clinic, such as differential efficacy of treatment as a function of stage of evolution of the given syndrome. Although serotonergic mechanisms do not appear central to the basic phenomena of sensitization and kindling, they appear capable of modulating their development and severity. As such, it becomes of considerable importance to assess whether serotonergic mechanisms that have been implicated in acute treatment of mood and anxiety syndromes are also involved in the longitudinal course and prevention of syndrome progression or occurrence. Identification of the more precise molecular mechanisms involved might provide a target for new therapeutic approaches to these recurrent and potentially disabling major psychiatric illnesses.},

Although tax studies have become increasingly sophisticated, especially during the past decade, they have tended to yield conflicting results regarding whether taxes matter. Some studies focus on costs and benefits of tax incentives, but few look to see whether public monies could have been better spent or whether tax incentives were economically justified. Tax studies offer little guidance to policy makers concerned about fine-tuning tax rates or tax offerings and effectively employing tax incentives as economic development tools.},

Specifically, the authors examined how response latency and self-report measures predicted bias and perceptions of bias in verbal and nonverbal behavior exhibited by Whites while they interacted with a Black partner. As predicted, Whites' self-reported racial attitudes significantly predicted bias in their verbal behavior to Black relative to White confederates. Furthermore, these explicit attitudes predicted how much friendlier Whites felt that they behaved toward White than Black partners. In contrast, the response latency measure significantly predicted Whites' nonverbal friendliness and the extent to which the confederates and observers perceived bias in the participants' friendliness.},

We examine these ideas using longitudinal data on a large sample of attorneys who graduated from one law school. Beauty is measured by having their matriculation photographs rated by a panel of observers. Better-looking attorneys who graduated in the 1970's earned more after 5 years of practice than their worse-looking classmates, other things equal, an effect that grew even larger by the fifteenth year of practice. We find no impact of beauty on earnings among 1980s graduates. Attorneys in the private sector are better-looking than those in the public sector, with the differences growing with experience, consistent with a widening of the difference in the absolute returns to beauty between the sectors and with the observation that looks affect the probability of attaining an early partnership. The results support a theory of dynamic sorting and the existence of consumer discrimination.},

To estimate impacts, we compare families that call when funds are available with those who call when they are not. We find that those calling when funding is available are 76{\%} less likely to enter a homeless shelter.

Immediately following the enactment of the ADA, the employment rate of people with disabilities declined. However, the long-term employment consequences of the ADA have not been studied. Interest in the long-term post-ADA employment trends of people with disabilities derives from the weakening of the ADA's employment provisions by U.S. Courts. The weakening of these provisions has decreased the cost to employers of hiring disabled employees. This paper uses variation in state disability laws and data from twenty-three years of the Current Population Survey to determine the long-term impact of the ADA on the employment of people with disabilities.},

An important aspect of these externalities that has not been previously emphasized is that the effects of agglomera- tion extend over at least three different dimensions. These are the industrial, geographic, and temporal scope of economic agglomeration economies. In each case, the literature suggests that agglomeration economies attenuate with distance. Recently, the literature has also begun to provide evidence on the microfoundations of external economies of scale. The best known of these sources are those attributed to Marshall (1920): labor market pooling, input sharing, and knowledge spillovers. Evidence to date supports the presence of all three of these forces. In addition, there is also evidence that natural advantage, home market effects, consumption opportunities, and rent-seeking all con- tribute to agglomeration.},

@article{Jolls2004,
abstract = {Studies of the effects of employment protection frequently examine protective legislation as a whole. From a policy reform perspective, however, it is often critical to know which particular aspect of the legislation is responsible for its observed effects. The American with Disabilities Act (ADA), a 1990 federal law covering over 40 million Americans, is a clear case in point. Several empirical studies have suggested that the passage of the ADA reduced rather than increased employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities. To the extent this is true, it is crucial to credibly disentangle the different features of this complex and multi-faceted law. Separately evaluating the distinct aspects of the ADA is important not only for determining how the law might best be reformed if some aspects of it produce negative employment effects, but also for improving our understanding of the potential consequences of ADA-like provisions in race and other civil rights laws. This paper exploits state-level variation in pre-ADA legal regimes governing disability discrimination to separately estimate the employment effects of each of the ADA's two primary substantive provisions. We find strong evidence that the immediate post-enactment employment effects of the ADA are attributable to its requirement of "reasonable accommodations" for disabled employees rather than to its potential imposition of firing costs for such employees. Moreover, the pattern of the ADA's effects across states suggests, contrary to widely discussed prior findings based on national-level data, that declining disabled employment after the immediate post-ADA period reflects other factors rather than the ADA itself.},

We analyze data on support for attacks against Israeli targets from public opinion polls conducted in the West Bank and Gaza Strip; support for violent attacks does not decrease among those with higher education and higher living standards. The core contribution of the paper is a statistical analysis of the determinants of participation in Hezbollah militant activities; having a living standard above the poverty line or a secondary or higher education is positively associated with participation in Hezbollah. We also find that Israeli Jewish settlers who attacked Palestinians in the West Bank in the early 1980s were overwhelmingly from high-paying occupations. Although our results are tentative and exploratory, they suggest that neither poverty nor education has a direct, causal impact on terrorism.},

One r{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}} in each pair was randomly assigned experience in a gay campus organization, and the other r{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}} was assigned a control organization. Two main findings have emerged. First, in some but not all states, there was significant discrimination against the fictitious applicants who appeared to be gay. This geographic variation in the level of discrimination appears to reflect regional differences in attitudes and antidiscrimination laws. Second, employers who emphasized the importance of stereotypically male heterosexual traits were particularly likely to discriminate against openly gay men. Beyond these particular findings, this study advances the audit literature more generally by covering multiple regions and by highlighting how audit techniques may be used to identify stereotypes that affect employment decisions in real labor markets.},

Given that many hiring decisions are presumably based on “gut-feelings”, implicit attitudes and stereotypes, more so than their explicit counterparts, may exert a substantial impact on how employers contemplate and make decisions regarding human resources.

Spending limits applied to both challengers and incumbents favor those already elected. Therefore limits on campaign spending will only be detrimental to challengers.

Correlational studies reveal that both the perceived size (studies 1 and 2) and actual size (study 2) of the racial minority population in their local environment predicts the extent to which whites report that they personally, and that whites as a group, face racial discrimination. Two experiments (studies 3 and 4) reveal that reading about growth in the racial minority share of the national population (versus control information) similarly increases whites' concerns about antiwhite discrimination. Overall, these findings suggest that increasing racial diversity, real or perceived, local or national, can elicit identity-relevant concerns among white Americans, including perceived vulnerability to racial discrimination.},

abstract = {T he current state of outpatient healthcare delivery is characterized by capacity shortages and long waits for appoint- ments, yet a substantial fraction of valuable doctors' capacity is wasted due to no-shows. In this study, we examine the effect of wait to appointment on patient flow, specifically on a patient's decision to schedule an appointment and to subsequently arrive to it. These two decisions may be dependent, as appointments are more likely to be scheduled by patients who are more patient and are thereby more likely to show up. To estimate the effect of wait on these two deci- sions, we introduce the willingness to wait (WTW), an unobservable variable that affects both bookings and arrivals for appointments. Using data from a large healthcare system, we estimate WTW with a state-of-the-art non-parametric method. The WTW, in turn, allows us to estimate the effect of wait on no-shows. We observe that the effect of increased wait on the likelihood of no-shows is disproportionately greater among patients with low WTW. Thus, although reducing the wait to an appointment will enable a provider to capture more patient bookings, the effects of wait time on capacity utilization can be non-monotone. Our counterfactual analysis suggests that increasing wait times can sometimes be benefi- cial for reducing no-shows. Key},

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to understand and identify the marketing strategies and specific promotional tools used by film commissions to attract the production of films and television. Design/methodology/approach – This study involved in-depth interviews with film commissions worldwide and a content analysis of their promotional materials. Findings –Film commissions employ three key strategic marketing approaches when promoting their locations to film producers - product differentiation, service differentiation and cost advantages. They use six main specific promotional tactics – advertising, sales promotions, joint promotions, public relations, online marketing, and direct marketing and personal selling. A model explaining the relationship between film commissions and film producers involving these strategies and promotional tools is suggested. Research limitations/implications – The marketing of film locations is under-researched and has to be further addressed in the marketing literature. Future research can seek to identify the specific marketing activities that will lead to success for the marketing of film locations. Practical Implications - Examples of the best marketing practices amongst film commissions are highlighted. Originality/value – This is an original contribution in that it is the first academic paper to address the marketing of film locations. It will be of significant value to film locations seeking to attract production to their locations.},

In addition to this, the fact that much of the literature that circulates is written in English and in an Anglophone context, hampers the ability of researchers to come into contact with other experiences of non/monogamies. This article gives a situated account of the rise of the Portuguese polyamorous social movement and shows how interpersonal relationships fundamentally shape the way activism is performed, and how archives are also important in establishing the identity of activists and activist groups. Using data from the Portuguese polyamorous group PolyPortugal, and interviews with high-profile activists, I argue that the idea of a politics of relating (the politicized analysis of how we connect and perform a given ethics of connection) is a conceptually useful tool to think about the transformations of contemporary intimacies, but it is also fundamental to think about how activism is done by people and for people – people who relate to one another, who exist in tension.},

abstract = {On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of Innovation System research, this paper presents an extensive literature review on this large field of innovation research. Building on an analytical basis of the commonalities “system” and “innovation”, the authors analyze the four main Innovation System approaches: National Innovation Systems (NIS), Regional Innovation Systems (RIS), Sectoral Innovation Systems (SIS) and Technological Innovation Systems (TIS). The analysis is structured systematically along ten comprehensive criteria. Starting with the founder(s) of each theory and the research program within each Innovation System approach was developed (1), the basic thoughts of each Innovation System approach are explained (2). For five case studies most cited (3), spatial boundaries are examined (4) and units of analyses are derived (5). By comparing the underlying theoretical concept and empirical results, the authors show patterns in the evolution of Innovation System research overall. By studying the basic components (6) and a functional analysis (7), each Innovation System approach is broken down into structural pieces and functional processes. If available, the authors present one or several taxonomies (8) for each Innovation System approach and summarize similar approaches (9), in order to classify and integrate the approaches into the ongoing innovation research. The identification of further research (10) shows which steps will need to be taken in the next years in order to evolve Innovation System research further and deeper. After the conclusion, the extensive table of comparison is presented which can serve as a guideline for academics and practitioners from basic and applied science, industry or policy that need to understand which Innovation System approach may be best for their specific analytical purposes.},

abstract = {One of the most common policy prescriptions to reduce the spread of COVID-19 has been to legally enforce social distancing through shelter-in-place orders (SIPOs). This study examines the role of localized urban SIPO policy in curbing COVID-19 cases. Specifically, we explore (i) the comparative effectiveness of county-level SIPOs in urbanized as compared to non-urbanized areas, (ii) the mechanisms through which SIPO adoption in urban counties yields COVID-related health benefits, and (iii) whether late adoption of a statewide SIPO yields health benefits beyond those achieved from early adopting counties. We exploit the unique laboratory of Texas, a state in which the early adoption of local SIPOs by densely populated counties covered almost two-thirds of the state's population prior to adoption of a statewide SIPO on April 2, 2020. Using an event study framework, we document that countywide SIPO adoption is associated with an 8 percent increase in the percent of residents who remain at home full-time and between a 13 to 19 percent decrease in foot-traffic at venues that may contribute to the spread of COVID-19 such as restaurants, bars, hotels, and entertainment venues. These social distancing effects are largest in urbanized and densely populated counties. Then, we find that in early adopting urban counties, COVID-19 case growth fell by 21 to 26 percentage points two-and-a-half weeks following adoption of a SIPO, a result robust to controls for county-level heterogeneity in COVID-19 outbreak timing, coronavirus testing, the age distribution, and political preferences. We find that approximately 90 percent of the curbed growth in COVID-19 cases in Texas came from the early adoption of SIPOs by urbanized counties, suggesting that the later statewide shelter-in-place mandate yielded relatively few health benefits.},

Our results show that sellers prefer transactional partners who live in advantaged neighborhoods to those who live in neighborhoods that are majority non-White and have higher rates of poverty. This was true across all four racial/ethnic groups, revealing that neighborhood stigma exists independently of racial stigma. We discuss the implications for scholarship on neighborhood effects and we outline how future research using experiments can leverage various types of markets to better specify when characteristics like race trigger discrimination.},

abstract = {This article develops and tests a simple dynamic model of statistical discrimination. The model improves on earlier static models both by allowing ex ante uncertainty about worker productivity to be resolved as on-the-job performance is observed and by generating several testable empirical implications. These predictions are tested using a sample of young men from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, producing mixed evidence for the model. The main empirical result is that no black-white wage gap exists at labor-force entry but that one develops as experience accumulates, mainly because blacks reap smaller gains from job mobility.},

abstract = {l discrimination occurs when distinctions between demographic groups are made on the basis of real or imagined statistical distinctions between the groups. While such discrimination is legal in some cases (e.g., insurance markets), it is illegal and/or controversial in others (e.g., racial profiling and gender-based labor market discrimination). "First-moment" statistical discrimination occurs when, for example, female workers are offered lower wages because females are perceived to be less productive, on average, than male workers. "Second-moment" discrimination would occur when risk-averse employers offer female workers lower wages based not on lower average productivity but on a higher variance in their productivity. This paper reports results from controlled laboratory experiments designed to study second-moment statistical discrimination in a labor market setting. Since decision-makers may not view risk in the same way as economists or statisticians (i.e., risk-variance of distribution), we also examine two possible alternative measures of risk: the support of the distribution, and the probability of earning less than the expected (maximum) profits for the employer. Our results indicate that individuals do respond to these alternative measures of risk, and employers made statistically discriminatory wage offers consistent with loss-aversion.},

We then tested and contrasted dimensions of discrimination as mediators between social status (race or gender) and mental health out-comes. Discrimination frequency and scope mediated the association between race and mental health, with a stronger effect via frequency among sexual minority women. Number of discrimination bases mediated the association between gen-der and mental health among Black sexual minorities.

abstract = {A geographically-resolved, multi-level Bayesian model is used to analyze the data presented in the U.S. Police-Shooting Database (USPSD) in order to investigate the extent of racial bias in the shooting of American civilians by police officers in recent years. In contrast to previous work that relied on the FBI's Supplemental Homicide Reports that were constructed from self-reported cases of police-involved homicide, this data set is less likely to be biased by police reporting practices. County-specific relative risk outcomes of being shot by police are estimated as a function of the interaction of: 1) whether suspects/civilians were armed or unarmed, and 2) the race/ethnicity of the suspects/civilians. The results provide evidence of a significant bias in the killing of unarmed black Americans relative to unarmed white Americans, in that the probability of being {\{}black, unarmed, and shot by police{\}} is about 3.49 times the probability of being {\{}white, unarmed, and shot by police{\}} on average. Furthermore, the results of multi-level modeling show that there exists significant heterogeneity across counties in the extent of racial bias in police shootings, with some counties showing relative risk ratios of 20 to 1 or more. Finally, analysis of police shooting data as a function of county-level predictors suggests that racial bias in police shootings is most likely to emerge in police departments in larger metropolitan counties with low median incomes and a sizable portion of black residents, especially when there is high financial inequality in that county. There is no relationship between county-level racial bias in police shootings and crime rates (even race-specific crime rates), meaning that the racial bias observed in police shootings in this data set is not explainable as a response to local-level crime rates.},

The author team comprises legal academics, scientists, researchers, and even a sitting federal judge who seek to answer this question in accordance with behavioral realism. The Article first provides a succinct scientific introduction to implicit bias, with some important theoretical clarifications that distinguish between explicit, implicit, and structural forms of bias. Next, the Article applies the science to two trajectories of bias relevant to the courtroom. One story follows a criminal defendant path; the other story follows a civil employment discrimination path. This application involves not only a focused scientific review but also a step-by-step examination of how criminal and civil trials proceed. Finally, the Article examines various concrete intervention strategies to counter implicit biases for key players in the justice system, such as the judge and jury. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {People with disabilities have low employment and wage levels, and some studies suggest employer discrimination is a contributing factor. Following the method of Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003), new evidence is presented from a field experiment that sent applications in response to 6,016 advertised accounting positions from well-qualified fictional applicants, with one-third of cover letters disclosing that the applicant has a spinal cord injury, one-third disclosing the presence of Asperger's Syndrome, and one-third not mentioning disability. These specific disabilities were chosen because they would not be expected to limit productivity in accounting, helping rule out productivity-based explanations for any differences in employer responses. Half of the resumes portrayed a novice accountant, and half portrayed an experienced one. The fictional applicants with disabilities received 26{\%} fewer expressions of employer interest than those without disabilities, with little difference between the two types of disability. The disability gap was concentrated among more experienced applicants, and among private companies with fewer than 15 employees that are not covered by the ADA, although comparable state statutes cover about half of them. Comparisons above and below disability law coverage thresholds point to a possible positive effect of the ADA on employer responses to applicants with disabilities, but no clear effects of state laws. The overall pattern of findings is consistent with the idea that disability discrimination continues to impede employment prospects of people with disabilities, and more attention needs to be paid to employer behavior and the demand side of the labor market for people with disabilities.},

abstract = {Background: This study assessed the relation of comorbid depressive syndrome with utilization of emergency department services and preventable inpatient hospitalizations among elderly individuals with chronic medical conditions. Research Design: A cross-sectional study. Setting: Individuals greater than or equal to 65 years of age living in the United States with Medicare part A and B fee-for-service coverage in 1999. Subjects: A 5{\%} random sample of elderly Medicare recipients (N = 1,238,895) of whom 60,382 (4.9{\%}) met criteria for a depressive syndrome. Measurements: Medicare beneficiaries were stratified based on the presence of at least 1 of the following medical conditions: coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, hypertension, prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, or colon cancer. For each stratum, we compared the odds of emergency department visits, all-cause hospitalization, and hospitalization for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC), conditions for which timely and effective medical care could decrease risk of hospitalization, for beneficiaries with and without a depressive syndrome. Results: Compared with those without a depressive syndrome, beneficiaries with a depressive syndrome were more likely to be older, white, and female (P {\textless}0.001). For each of the 8 chronic medical conditions, elderly beneficiaries with a depressive syndrome were at least twice as likely to use emergency department services (range of adjusted odds ratios, 2.12-3.16; P {\textless}0.001); medical inpatient hospital services (range of adjusted odds ratios, 2.59-3.71; P {\textless}0.001); and medical inpatient hospital services associated with an ACSC (range of adjusted odds ratios, 1.72-2.68; P {\textless}0.001) as compared with those without a depressive syndrome. Conclusions: For elderly individuals with at least 1 chronic medical condition, the presence of a depressive syndrome increased the odds of acute medical service use, suggesting that improvements in clinical management, access to mental health services, and coordination of medical and mental health services could reduce utilization.

abstract = {Difference-in-differences (DID) is a method to evaluate the effect of a treatment. In its basic version, a "control group" is untreated at two dates, whereas a "treatment group" becomes fully treated at the second date. However, in many applications of the DID method, the treatment rate only increases more in the treatment group. In such fuzzy designs, a popular estimator of treatment effects is the DID of the outcome divided by the DID of the treatment. We show that this ratio identifies a local average treatment effect only if two homogeneous treatment effect assumptions are satisfied. We then propose two alternative estimands that do not rely on any assumption on treatment effects, and that can be used when the treatment rate does not change over time in the control group. We prove that the corresponding estimators are asymptotically normal. Finally, we use our results to revisit Duflo (2001).},

In the game, payoff relevant information is presented to subjects, thereby making it costly to discriminate when choosing group members. We find that behavior is correlated with race and people use race to predict behavior. However, race only matters when information on behavior is absent. These results are further confirmed when incentives are in place to encourage behavior that is counter to stereotypes. Not all subjects discriminate in the same way, suggesting unfamiliarity and some in-group, out-group bias.

Many researchers have argued that depressive symptoms are associated with conflicts between American Indian traditional cultural values, practices, and beliefs and those of the majority culture. This report, based on a sample 287 American Indian adults from the upper Midwest, takes into account two measures of cultural effects: perceived discrimination, as one indicator of culture conflict, and traditional practices, as a measure of cultural identification. The results indicate that discrimination is strongly associated with depressive symptoms among American Indian adults and that engaging in traditional practices is negatively related to depressive symptoms. Moreover, interaction effects between perceived discrimination and traditional practices indicate that engaging in traditional practices buffers the negative effects of discrimination among those who regularly participate in them.},

Twelve goals for multicultural counselling and therapy are presented and discussed: reconciliation, support, coping with post-traumatic stress, assisting acculturation and assimilation, avoiding further marginalization, addressing racial and cultural discrimination, assisting clients to manage close cross-cultural relationships, assisting clients to manage intergenerational conflict, assisting long-stay transients and expatriates, assisting with gender role and equality issues, attaining higher levels of development, and the good society. As the world gets more interconnected, addressing each of these areas of multicultural counselling and therapy is going to become increasingly important.

In the stores studied, cashiers work with different managers on different days and their schedules are determined quasi-randomly. When minority cashiers, but not majority cashiers, are scheduled to work with managers who are biased (as determined by an implicit association test), they are absent more often, spend less time at work, scan items more slowly, and take more time between customers. This appears to be because biased managers interact less with minorities, leading minorities to exert less effort. Manager bias has consequences for the average performance of minority workers: while on average minority and majority workers perform equivalently, on days where managers are unbiased, minorities perform significantly better than do majority workers. The findings are consistent with statistical discrimination in hiring whereby because minorities underperform when assigned to biased managers, the firm sets a higher hiring standard for minorities to get similar average performance from minority and nonminority workers.},

Exploiting variation in the severity and timing of the recession across states, we estimate the effect of unemployment on SSDI applications and awards. We find the Great Recession induced nearly one million SSDI applications that otherwise would not have been filed, of which 41.8{\%} were awarded benefits, resulting in over 400,000 new beneficiaries who made up 8.9{\%} of all SSDI entrants between 2008 and 2012. More than one-half of the recession-induced awards were made on appeal. The induced applicants had less severe impairments than the average applicant. Only 9{\%} had the most severe, automatically-qualifying impairments, 33{\%} had functional impairments and no transferable skills, and the rest were denied for having insufficiently severe impairments and/or transferable skills. Our estimates imply the Great Recession increased claims processing costs by {\$}2.960 billion during 2008–2012, and SSDI benefit obligations by {\$}55.730 billion in present value, or {\$}97.365 billion including both SSDI and Medicare benefits.},

abstract = {This article begins by providing an overview of the Disability Insurance program, describing who qualifies for the program, how an individual applies for benefits and how the level of benefits is determined.3 Next, we summarize the factors that are responsible for the growth in the DI rolls and discuss how the characteristics of DI recipients have changed as a result. We then explore the extent of moral hazard in the DI program and the effectiveness of the screening process in distinguishing meritorious from nonmeritorious claims. The subsequent section identifies the challenges that the DI program creates for Social Security finances and Social Security reform. In the final section, we discuss potential reforms to the DI program. An overarching issue raised by our discussion is that five decades of congressional reforms and extensions of Disability Insurance have left the program with an ill-defined mission. Although the program nominally exists to insure workers' labor income against disabling medical events, the DI screening procedure put in place by Congress hinges to a significant extent on an applicant's employability, not just personal health, causing the program to function much like a long-term unemployment insurance program for the unemployable. Ultimately, we believe that Congress must clarify whether the primary social objective of the DI program is to provide disability insurance or to provide employability insurance—and if the former, to revise the selection criteria accordingly. Short of this objective, we suggest below that the two most promising near-term opportunities for reform entail revamping the disability appeals process—in which the Social Security Administration currently loses nearly three-quarters of all appeals—and reducing the attractiveness of DI benefits for work-capable disabled individuals by providing additional access to public health insurance},

abstract = {The purpose of our review is to evaluate critically the recent literature on racial and ethnic disparities in pain and to determine how far we have come toward reducing and eliminating disparities in pain. We examined peer-reviewed research articles published between 1990 and early 2009 that focused on racial and ethnic disparities in pain in the United States. The databases used were PubMed, Medline, Scopus, CINAHL, and PsycInfo. The probable causes of minority group disparities in pain are discussed, along with suggested strategies for eliminating pain-related disparities. This review reveals the persistence of racial and ethnic disparities in acute, chronic, cancer, and palliative pain care across the lifespan and treatment settings, with minorities receiving lesser quality pain care than non-Hispanic whites. Although health and health care disparities attract local, state, and federal attention, disparities in pain care continue to be missing from publicized public health agendas and health care reform plans. Ensuring optimal pain care for all is critically important from a public health and policy perspective. A robust research program on disparities in pain is needed, and the results must be successfully translated into practices and policies specifically designed to reduce and eliminate disparities in care. Perspective: This review evaluates the recent literature on racial and ethnic disparities in pain and pain treatment. Racial and ethnic disparities in acute pain, chronic cancer pain, and palliative pain care continue to persist. Rigorous research is needed to develop interventions, practices, and policies for eliminating disparities in pain. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Pain Society.},

Results indicated considerable overlapping of estimated ages across age categories, suggesting that the boundaries between adjacent age stages are highly permeable. Sex-of-photo exerted a major influence on categorization and preference. Female, relative to male, stimulus persons were assigned to older age categories, were perceived to attain middle-aged and elderly status sooner, and were younger when chosen as most preferred (but only for male subjects). These sex-bias effects were mitigated in the oldest respondent. Relevance of the present research to problems of age stereotyping is discussed.},

abstract = {This article presents two alternative explanations for the role of stars in motion pictures. Either informed insiders signal project quality by hiring an expensive star, or stars capture their expected economic rent. These approaches are tested on a sample of movies produced in the 1990s. Means comparisons suggest that star‐studded films bring in higher revenues. However, regressions show that any big budget investment increases revenues. Sequels, highly visible films and “family oriented” ratings also contribute to revenues. A higher return on investment is correlated only with G or PG ratings and marginally with sequels. This is consistent with the “rent capture” hypothesis.},

First, men's and women's beliefs about both oneself and others exceed observed ability on average, particularly in difficult tasks. Second, overestimation of ability by both men and women varies across categories. To understand these patterns, we develop a model that separates gender stereotypes from misestimation of ability related to the difficulty of the task. We find that stereotypes contribute to gender gaps in self-confidence, assessments of others, and behavior in a cooperative game. (JEL C92, D83, D91, J16).},

abstract = {The presence of multiple parameters complicates statistical inference. Ignoring the presence of multiple parameters can result in misleading inferences while existing remedies often produce inferences too imprecise to be economically meaningful. This article proposes an approach to inference on multiple parameters that produces valid simultaneous inferences on multiple parameters while maintaining precision on the parameter or parameters of greatest interest. The approach allows inference to reflect differing preferences for precision that the researcher may have across parameters, resulting in hypothesis tests that are more powerful and confidence regions with shorter projections on the parameters that the researcher cares more about, while remaining jointly valid across all parameters. A researcher using the procedure specifies in advance non-negative weights that correspond to the relative preference for precision across parameters. The proposed procedure chooses a confidence region to minimize the weighted sum of the projections on the parameter dimensions. A decision theoretic framework presents axioms for researcher preferences under which the proposed procedure is optimal. An empirical example from a field experiment on charitable giving shows the method offers substantial improvements in real-world settings.},

abstract = {We consider nonparametric identification and estimation in a nonseparable model where a continuous regressor of interest is a known, deterministic, but kinked function of an observed assignment variable. This design arises in many institutional settings where a policy variable (such as weekly unemployment benefits) is determined by an observed but potentially endogenous assignment variable (like previous earnings). We provide new results on identification and estimation for these settings, and apply our results to obtain estimates of the elasticity of joblessness with respect to UI benefit rates. We characterize a broad class of models in which a sharp “Regression Kink Design” (RKD, orRKDesign) identifies a readily interpretable treatment-on-the-treated parameter (Florens et al. (2008)). We also introduce a “fuzzy regression kink design” generalization that allows for omitted variables in the assignment rule, noncompliance, and certain types of measurement errors in the observed values of the assignment variable and the policy variable. Our identifying assumptions give rise to testable restrictions on the distributions of the assignment variable and predetermined covariates around the kink point, similar to the restrictions delivered by Lee (2008) for the regression discontinuity design. We then use a fuzzy RKD approach to study the effect of unemployment insurance benefits on the duration of joblessness in Austria, where the benefit schedule has kinks at the minimum and maximum benefit level. Our preferred estimates suggest that changes in UI benefit generosity exert a relatively large effect on the duration of joblessness of both low-wage and high-wage UI recipients in Austria.},

Differentiating between practice assistants and physicians as responders, we find that physicians provide significantly shorter response times and marginally significant shorter waiting times for appointments for patients with than without a university degree. Our results thus provide unambiguous evidence that discrimination by health providers contributes to the gradient in access to care.

Our project has studied a number of locations, most of which have shown spectacular rates of growth of information and communcations technology-related activities during the 1990s. Our case studies comprise some emerging regions, notably in Ireland, India, Israel and Taiwan, along with more advanced areas like Northern Virginia in the US, Cambridge, UK, the Scandinavian countries and the Silicon Valley 40 years ago by way of the memory of one of its father founders', Gordon Moore. Through visits, interviews and other materials, we uncovered some regularities about the determinants of success of these entrepreneurial-led models of economic growth. We find that the economic factors that give rise to the start of a cluster can be very different from those that keep it going. Agglomeration economies, external effects and social increasing returns' of any sort arise almost naturally after a cluster has taken off. But the most difficult and risky part is to get the new clusters started. At that stage, old economy' factors like firm-building capabilities, managerial skills, a substantial supply of skilled labor and connection to markets were crucial for the take off of these new economy' clusters (including Silicon Valley 40 years ago).},

Furthermore, the authors show that using the sample of the working-age population with disabilities identified by the six-question sequence will lead to biased estimates of key social policy success parameters; in particular, it will overestimate their employment rates and underestimate the share that are receiving Social Security Disability Insurance or Supplemental Security Income-Disabled Adults benefits relative to the broader sample that includes a work-limitation question and the six-question sequence. },

@article{Flake2019,
abstract = {Ban-the-box laws, which delay an employer's inquiry into an applicant's criminal record until later in the hiring process, are gaining remarkable traction at the local, state, and even federal levels. But the assumption that employers will be more likely to hire ex-offenders if forced to evaluate their qualifications before discovering their criminal record has gone largely untested. Empirical uncertainty has given rise to various criticisms of ban-the-box laws, chiefly that they merely postpone the inevitable decision not to hire the ex-offender - often at considerable cost to both the employer and applicant - and, worse yet, that they may actually harm racial minorities by prompting employers to assume all minority applicants have a criminal record in light of their much higher arrest and incarceration rates, and eliminate them from consideration on that basis. This Article reports the findings of a field experiment that tests both of these criticisms. The experiment entailed applying to food-service job openings in Chicago, which bans the box in private employment, and Dallas, which does not, using a fictitious ex-offender applicant profile. One-third of the applications in each city used a black-soUnding name, one-third used a Latino-soUnding name, and the other third used a white-soUnding name. Each application was tracked to determine whether it elicited an employer callback (i.e., a request for an interview or additional information). Multiple regression modeling was then used to compare callback differentials between cities and across races. The results refute the contention that ban-the-box laws do not increase employment opportunities for ex-offenders, as applicants were 27{\%} more likely to receive a callback in Chicago than in Dallas. The results likewise contradict the claim that banning the box harms racial minorities. All three races had higher callback rates when the box was banned, with the black applicant experiencing the largest increase. Still, the black applicant had much lower callback rates than the white and Latino applicants in both Chicago and Dallas, indicating race remains a formidable barrier to employment, regardless of whether an employer is aware of a candidate's criminal record. In light of these findings that banning the box increases an ex-offender's odds of employment without harming racial minorities, this Article considers the potential costs and benefits of ban-the-box laws, both standing alone and as part of broader efforts to successfully reintegrate ex-offenders into society. Although banning the box may prove helpful in improving ex-offenders' job prospects, it is hardly sufficient; more is required to ensure that upon release, an ex-offender's prison sentence does not become a life sentence.},

Our results indicate that the likelihood of receiving a callback for an interview significantly decreases with the length of a worker's unemployment spell, with the majority of this decline occurring during the first eight months. We explore how this effect varies with local labor market conditions and find that duration dependence is stronger when the local labor market is tighter. This result is consistent with the prediction of a broad class of screening models in which employers use the unemployment spell length as a signal of unobserved productivity and recognize that this signal is less informative in weak labor markets.

Taste-based models can generate wage and unemployment duration differentials when combined with either random or directed search even when strong prejudice is not widespread, but no existing model explains the unemployment rate differential. Models of statistical discrimination based on differential observability of productivity across races can explain the pattern and magnitudes of wage differentials but do not address employment and unemployment. At their current state of development, models of statistical discrimination based on rational stereotypes have little empirical content. It is plausible that models combining elements of the search models with statistical discrimination could ft the data. We suggest possible avenues to be pursued and comment briefy on the implication of existing theory for public policy.},

However, the emergence of multigenerational societies does not necessarily guarantee the eradication of ageism or age-related stereotypes. In this new social landscape, the civic mission of higher education includes the expansion of the educational toolbox for future professionals with instruments devoted to improve communication between generations. In this chapter, we refer to the intergroup contact theory, which supports intergenerational contact between young and old, not as individuals of different ages who coincide in chronological time, but as members of a community from different generations, as it is framed in the generational intelligence educational model. After presenting the theoretical background, a particular intergenerational service learning methodology is proposed and a case study, developed at Fontys University of Applied Sciences and Summa College in Eindhoven is described. This methodology is based on instructing students, not only on technical contents of a discipline but also on developing communication skills between generations. This communication tries to empathize with the ideas, interests and feelings of other generations, potentially leading to a reduction of prejudice. The chapter ends with limitations and future proposals related to generational education as an effective tool against ageism.},

They find that lesbian women earned more than heterosexual women irrespective of marital status, while gay men earned less than their married heterosexual counterparts but more than their cohabitating heterosexual counterparts. Results of a Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition indicate that the relative wage advantages observed for some groups of lesbians and gay men were mainly owing to greater levels of human capital accumulation (particularly education), while occupational sorting had little or no influence. The relative wage penalties that were observed in other cases, however, cannot be attributed either to differences in occupational sorting or to human capital. An analysis employing a DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux decomposition, which allows for variation in the wage gap at different points along the wage distribution, broadly confirms these results},

This paper examines the labor market impacts of investment subsidized by the U.S. federal government's New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program, which provides tax incentives to promote business investment in low-income neighborhoods. To identify the program's effects, I exploit a discontinuity in the rule determining the eligibility of census tracts for NMTC-subsidized investment. Using rich administrative data on workers' residence and workplace locations, I find evidence that many of the new jobs created in areas that receive subsidized investment do not go to residents of targeted neighborhoods. The results suggest that the local economic benefits of place-based programs may be diluted when subsidized businesses have scope to hire from broader regional labor markets.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the effect of Europe's largest public housing program on socioeconomic outcomes for low-income households. Using lotteries for housing units in the Netherlands and data linking national registers to application choices, I show that the average move into public housing negatively affects labor market outcomes and proxies for neighborhood quality, and increases public assistance receipt. However, consistent with a model of labor supply responses to conditional in-kind transfers, average impacts miss substantial heterogeneity both across neighborhoods and, within neighborhood, across recipients. Moves into high-income neighborhoods generate positive effects, which are driven by 'upward' moves made by individuals previously living in low-or middle-income neighborhoods. Lateral and 'downward' moves have the opposite effect. To evaluate whether these results generalize to non-recipients, I develop a model of application behavior that utilizes panel data on application choices and exploits variation induced by the housing allocation mechanism. Using the model, I recover the distribution of heterogeneity that drives selection into and returns from lotteries, and estimate that selection on gains is limited. This suggests that targeting public housing in high-income neighborhoods based on observable characteristics can increase economic self-sufficiency.},

This article addresses this gap by examining racial and ethnic inequality in homeownership and housing equity among the pre- retirement population. Results support a stratification perspective of inequality for both blacks and Hispanics; cven after accounting for numerous life-cycle, resource, and social-psychological considerations, blacks and Hispanics continue to lag signifi- cantly behind whites in housing wcalth. While Hispanics initially appear better off than blacks with respect to housing, this is largely a function of their more favorable family structure. lmportant differences between blacks and Hispanics in the main contributors to housing inequality highlight the need to take a more multiethnic per- spective on wealth stratification.},

In addition, a focus on the average impact of the program would lead to the conclusion that it mostly succeeded in displacing preexisting firms, but a lower level of spatial isolation was a clear determinant of the decision to create new firms from scratch},

Analyses focused on 524 respondents with diabetes from the 2001 Commonwealth Health Care Quality Survey. Probit models estimated the marginal effect of self-reported racial/ethnic and gender discrimination on diabetes management, adjusting for racial/ethnic and gender concordance of the patient and physician, as well as a variety of health and sociodemographic indicators. Self-reported racial/ethnic discrimination was associated with a roughly 50{\%} lower marginal probability of receiving a hemoglobin A1c test, foot exam, and blood pressure exam, when accounting for racial/ethnic and gender physician-patient concordance and other factors. Self-reported gender discrimination was associated with 22{\%} lower marginal probability of conducting a hemoglobin test but not associated with the other management indicators. Evidence from this study suggests that racial/ethnic discrimination is an important barrier to diabetes management.},

Rapid program growth despite improving aggregate health appears to be explained by reduced screening stringency, declining demand for less skilled workers, and an unforeseen increase in the earnings replacement rate. We estimate that the sum of these forces doubled the labor force exit propensity of displaced high school dropouts after 1984, lowering measured U. S. unemployment by one-half a percentage point. Steady state calculations augur a further 40 percent increase in the rate of DI receipt.},

Sample means indicate that both men and women experience a persistent obesity wage penalty over the first two decades of their careers. We then control for a standard set of socioeconomic and familial variables but find that standard covariates do not explain why obese workers experience persistent wage penalties. This suggests that other variables -- including job discrimination, health-related factors and/or obese workers' behavior patterns -- may be the channels through which obesity adversely affects wages. The study closes with a discussion of the public policy implications suggested by these findings.},

abstract = {The dearth of minority entrepreneurs has received increasing media attention but few academic analyses. In particular, the funding process creates challenges for either audit or correspondence methods, making it difficult to assess the role, or type, of discrimination influencing resource providers. We use a novel approach that combines analyses of 7,617 crowdfunding projects with an experimental design to identify whether African American men are discriminated against and whether this reflects statistical, taste-based, or unconscious bias on the part of prospective supporters.We find that African American men are significantly less likely than similar white founders to receive funding and that prospective supporters rate identical projects as lower in quality when they believe the founder is an African American male.We conclude that the reduction in perceived quality does not reflect conscious assumptions of differences in founder ability or disamenity but rather an unconscious assumption that black founders are lower quality. In two additional experiments, we identify three means of reducing this bias: Through additional evidence of quality via third-party endorsements (i.e., awards, evidence of prior support), through evidence that African American founders have succeeded previously, and by removing indicators of the founder's race.},

We adopt a randomized correspondence audit design by sending inquiry emails to randomly selected property owners or agents from Craigslist. The signals are conveyed by names, body text, and signature-line quotations. The findings suggest landlords have preferences about tenants and make decisions based on signals communicated in inquiry emails from potential applicants. Blacks, Arab males, Muslims, and single parents are treated unfavorably while gay couples are preferred. These discrimination patterns are generally consistent with the theory of agent-based statistical discrimination. The results provide evidence that many groups protected under U.S. fair housing law continue to face obstacles when searching for housing despite decades of fair housing law.},

The framework distinguishes between stigma's manifestations in society's institutions (heterosexism) and among individuals. The latter include enacted sexual stigma (overt negative actions against sexual minorities, such as hate crimes), felt sexual stigma (expectations about the circumstances in which sexual stigma will be enacted), and internalized sexual stigma (personal acceptance of sexual stigma as part of one's value system and self-concept). Drawing from previous research on internalized sexual stigma among heterosexuals (i.e., sexual prejudice), the article considers possible parallels in how sexual minorities experience internalized sexual stigma (i.e., self-stigma, or negative attitudes toward the self).

abstract = {Fiscal rules attempt to alter budget outcomes by constraining policy makers. They have been one of the primary responses to the recent string of fiscal crises around the globe. We ask if these rules succeed in altering fiscal outcomes by examining what is arguably the most stringent set of fiscal rules in the U.S.—Colorado's Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR). As TABOR attempts to constrain both taxes and expenditures, we develop a novel approach of estimating treatment effects for multiple outcomes simultaneously using the synthetic control methodology of Abadie et al. (2010). Although there will always be a degree of uncertainty over external validity when a policy is enacted in only a single state, our results provide no evidence that TABOR affected the level of taxes or spending in Colorado and are precise enough to rule out large negative effects. Thus, no support is found for the contention that fiscal rules alter budget outcomes. Instead, TABOR appears to have been partly evaded by policy makers and voters despite its stringency and partly nothing more than a ratification of the state's preference over the size of its public sector.},

abstract = {The paper concentrates on the problem of age discrimination in the labour market and the way it can be conceptualised and measured in a multi-disciplinary way. The approach proposed here combines two understandings of age discrimination—a sociological and legal one, what allows for a fuller and expanded understanding of ageism in the workplace. At the heart of the study is a survey carried out in Poland with a sample of 1000 men and women aged 45–65 years. The study takes a deeper and innovative look into the issue of age discrimination in employment. Confirmatory factor analysis with WLSMV estimation and logistic regressions were used to test the hypotheses. The study shows that age discrimination in labour market can take on different forms: hard and soft, where the hard type of age discrimination mirrors the legally prohibited types of behaviours and those which relate to the actual decisions of employers which can impact on the employee's career development. The soft discrimination corresponds with those occurrences, which are not inscribed in the legal system per se, are occurring predominantly in the interpersonal sphere, but can nevertheless have negative consequences. Soft discrimination was experienced more often (28.6{\%} of respondents) than hard discrimination (15.7{\%}) with higher occurrences among women, persons in precarious job situation or residents of urban areas. The role of education was not confirmed to influence the levels of perceived age discrimination.},

abstract = {The research on which this article is based examined the relationship between attitudes towards older workers held by personnel managers and directors in large organisations (500 or more employees) across virtually the whole range of industrial sectors (excluding agriculture), and their employment practices. The aims of the research were to explore the operation of workplace social closure and the social construction of age in organisations, and to provide practical information to better inform policy making towards older workers. Analysis indicated that attitudes associated with recruitment, training and promotion practices were: perceived trainability, creativity, cautiousness, physical capabilities, the likelihood of having an accident, and ability to work with younger workers. Attitudes which showed no relationship with employment practices were: perceived productivity, reliability, ability to adapt to new technology, interest in technological change and flexibility. It is argued that these findings stress the need to target stereotypical attitudes towards older workers if age barriers in employment are to be removed. However, it is also argued that educational campaigns alone are likely to exert only limited influence against a background of a long-term decline in economic activity rates among older workers. The research also indicates that future research studies need to take greater account of potential differences between different groups of older workers. KEY},

Using a systematic review methodology, 18 publications were identified (published in English language since 2000 to 2014 in relevant peer-reviewed journals). The main findings of selected empirical studies indicated that: a) there is the need to focus HR management policies on older workers; b) age stereotypes toward older workers are multidimensional and there is the simultaneous existence of both positive and negative stereotypical beliefs; c) managers' age stereotypes can affect several organizational outcomes. Self-categorization theory and intergroup bias are recommended as promising theoretical approaches for studying age stereotypes toward older workers and their cognitive identification with the age group.},

abstract = {Purpose: Using Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Services Utilization, we examined the associations between negative experience in a health care setting and subsequent reductions in health care utilization among African American sexual minority women (SMW). Methods: The data were collected as part of a larger study exploring health and health care experiences of a volunteer sample of African American SMW (n = 226). We examined predisposing, enabling, and need factors as predictors of a negative experience and changes in health care utilization. Results: More than one-third of the sample reported a negative health care experience in the past 5-years. One fourth of those reporting a negative experience attributed it to discrimination including race/ethnicity (70.4{\%}), gender (58.2{\%}), and sexual orientation (46.2{\%}). (The categories were not mutually exclusive). Reduction in health care utilization (i.e., didn't see a doctor next time when they were ill) following the negative experience was common (34{\%}). Predisposing (younger age), enabling (lack of insurance, part-time employment, and no regular provider), and need factors (living with a chronic illness) predicted experiencing a negative event. In multivariate analysis, health care factors (quality of health care, negative experience due to discrimination) and patient factors (passive coping response) were factors associated with reduced health care utilization. Conclusion: Problems in the patient-provider relationship were a significant factor in decreasing healthcare use among SMW. Anderson's model helped to inform our understanding of who might be at risk of experiencing a negative experience but not subsequent changes in health care utilization. Modifiable variables related to the health care environment and patient coping responses predicted changes in health care use.},

This article reviews theoretical explanations of socially motivated misreporting in sensitive surveys and provides an overview of the empirical evidence on the effectiveness of specific survey methods designed to encourage the respondents to answer more honestly. Besides psychological aspects, like a stable need for social approval and the preference for not getting involved into embarrassing social interactions, aspects of the survey design, the interviewer's characteristics and the survey situation determine the occurrence and the degree of social desirability bias. The review shows that survey designers could generate more valid data by selecting appropriate data collection strategies that reduce respondents' discomfort when answering to a sensitive question.},

abstract = {Purpose: There has been an increasing number of allegations of discrimination toward US employees and anecdotal indications of immigrant employee exploitation in the information technology sector. The purpose of this paper is to investigate if applicants' work visa status causes native-born applicants to be treated differentially (less favorably) than foreign-born applicants. Design/methodology/approach: A correspondence study design is used to observe differential screening processes by measuring the frequency of favorable job application responses received by foreign-born applicants compared to equally skilled native-born applicants. Findings: Results from the study suggest that fictitious Asian foreign-born applicants who demonstrate the need for H-1B work visa sponsorship for employment receive significantly more favorable e-mail responses to job ads than US native-born applicants. Moreover, white native-born applicants are approximately 23 percent less likely than Asian foreign-born applicants to receive a request for an interview. Research limitations/implications: Because of the chosen method, the research results may lack generalizability. The hypotheses should be tested further by targeting more geographical locations, a variety of industries and using qualitative methods in future research. Practical implications: The paper includes implications for hiring managers who wish to reduce their liability for employment discrimination and foreign-born job seekers wishing to manage their expectations of the recruitment process. Originality/value: This paper fulfills an identified need to empirically study how the work visa status of job seekers affects early recruitment as increasingly more anecdotal evidence of immigrant exploitation and discrimination in the technology sector is reported.},

abstract = {In this review, we present econometric and statistical methods for analyzing randomized experiments. For basic experiments we stress randomization-based inference as opposed to sampling-based inference. In randomization-based inference, uncertainty in estimates arises naturally from the random assignment of the treatments, rather than from hypothesized sampling from a large population. We show how this perspective relates to regression analyses for randomized experiments. We discuss the analyses of stratified, paired, and clustered randomized experiments, and we stress the general efficiency gains from stratification. We also discuss complications in randomized experiments such as non-compliance. In the presence of non-compliance we contrast intention-to-treat analyses with instrumental variables analyses allowing for general treatment effect heterogeneity. We consider in detail estimation and inference for heterogeneous treatment effects in settings with (possibly many) covariates. These methods allow researchers to explore heterogeneity by identifying subpopulations with different treatment effects while maintaining the ability to construct valid confidence intervals. We also discuss optimal assignment to treatment based on covariates in such settings. Finally, we discuss estimation and inference in experiments in settings with interactions between units, both in general network settings and in settings where the population is partitioned into groups with all interactions contained within these groups.},

Participants were recruited through targeted sampling, respondent-driven sampling, and agency referrals in San Francisco. The prevalence of attempted suicide was 32{\%} (95{\%} CI = 28{\%} to 36{\%}). In multivariate logistic regression analysis younger age ({\textless}25 years), depression, a history of substance abuse treatment, a history of forced sex, gender-based discrimination, and gender-based victimization were independently associated with at- tempted suicide. Suicide prevention interventions for transgender per- sons are urgently needed, particularly for young people. Medical, mental health, and social service providers should address depression, sub- stance abuse, and forced sex in an attempt to reduce suicidal behaviors among transgender persons. In addition, increasing societal acceptance of the transgender community and decreasing gender-based prejudice may help prevent suicide in this highly stigmatized population. doi:10.1300/J082v51n03{\_}04},

Building subsidized arenas and stadiums for professional sports teams downtown became common in the 1990s. In recent years, downtown stadiums and arenas have been proposed as components in larger redevelopment projects containing a number of other amenities, as well, including housing and other entertainment attractions. The justification for such developments rests in part on the public goods generated by vibrant, prosperous downtowns. Yet little is known about the value of such downtown public goods. This paper reports the results of two Contingent Valuation Method surveys to determine willingness to pay for new National Hockey League arenas in downtown Edmonton and Calgary in the Canadian province of Alberta. The hypothetical scenarios in both surveys varied to include affordable housing, a casino, and cultural space in addition to the arena. The surveys provide the first estimates of willingness to pay for downtown public goods for sports arenas, and also provide the first estimates of scope effects, that is, the willingness to pay for expansions of public goods, in the sports economics literature. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper applies semiparametric regression models to shed light on the relationship between body weight and labor market outcomes in Germany. We find conclusive evidence that these relationships are poorly described by linear or quadratic OLS specifications, which have been the main approaches in previous studies.Women's wages and employment probabilities do not follow a linear relationship and are highest at a body weight far below the clinical threshold of obesity. This indicates that looks, rather than health, is the driving force behind the adverse labor market outcomes to which overweight women are subject. Further support is lent to this notion by the fact that wage penalties for overweight and obese women are only observable in white-collar occupations. On the other hand, bigger appears to be better in the case of men, for whom employment prospects increase with weight, albeit with diminishing returns. However, underweight men in blue-collar jobs earn lower wages because they lack the muscular strength required in such occupations.},

Dong and Lewbel (2015) show how a derivative of this effect, called treatment effect derivative (TED) can be estimated. We argue here that TED should be employed in most RD applications, as a way to assess the stability and hence external validity of RD estimates. Closely related to TED, we define the complier probability derivative (CPD). Just as TED measures stability of the treatment effect, the CPD measures stability of the complier population in fuzzy designs. TED and CPD are numerically trivial to estimate. We provide relevant Stata code, and apply it to some real datasets.},

@article{Quadlin2018,
abstract = {Women earn better grades than men across levels of education—but to what end? This article assesses whether men and women receive equal returns to academic performance in hiring. I conducted an audit study by submitting 2,106 job applications that experimentally manipulated applicants' GPA, gender, and college major. Although GPA matters little for men, women benefit from moderate achievement but not high achievement. As a result, high-achieving men are called back significantly more often than high-achieving women—at a rate of nearly 2-to-1. I further find that high-achieving women are most readily penalized when they major in math: high-achieving men math majors are called back three times as often as their women counterparts. A survey experiment conducted with 261 hiring decision-makers suggests that these patterns are due to employers' gendered standards for applicants. Employers value competence and commitment among men applicants, but instead privilege women applicants who are perceived as likeable. This standard helps moderate-achieving women, who are often described as sociable and outgoing, but hurts high-achieving women, whose personalities are viewed with more skepticism. These findings suggest that achievement invokes gendered stereotypes that penalize women for having good grades, creating unequal returns to academic performance at labor market entry.},

abstract = {This article presents the findings of the first field experiment - a resume correspondence study - on age discrimination in the Russian labor market. Correspondence studies are nowadays viewed as the most objective way to test for hiring discrimination. Th is method consists of sending pairs of CVs for job offers, very similar in everything except the trait to be analyzed (age in our case). Data collection for the presented study was conducted in February-March 2018. Pairs of matched applications, one from a fictitious 29-year-old female applicant and one from a fictitious 48-year-old female applicant, were sent to 341 employers with job openings for accountants in Moscow, posted on one of the most popular job search websites. It turned out that the probability of receiving an invitation for an interview for an older candidate is 24-32{\%}, whereas for a younger candidate it is 45-52{\%}. Th us, the positive callback ratio is 1.8-2.5. The indicator of "net discrimination", calculated as the difference in the shares of positive callbacks in the number of vacancies for which at least one response has been received, is 37-49{\%} for the younger and ol der candidates. Compared with the results of the existing studies, it turns out that the obtained discrimination level is quite high. Taking into account the population aging, a reduction in the workforce and an increase in the official retirement age, measures must be taken to combat age discrimination and allow older people to work on an equal basis with young people.},

These effects attenuate, with nearby activity exerting the strongest effects. The attenuation of agglomeration economies has implications for urban spatial structure, the microfoundations of agglomeration economies, and commercial real estate.

Although the ADA was meant to increase the employment of the disabled, the net theoretical effects are ambiguous. For men of all working ages and women under 40, Current Population Survey data show a sharp drop in the employment of disabled workers after the ADA went into effect. Although the number of disabled individuals receiving disability transfers increased at the same time, the decline in employment of the disabled does not appear to be explained by increasing transfers alone, leaving the ADA as a likely cause. Consistent with this view, the effects of the ADA appear larger in medium-size firms, possibly because small firms were exempt from the ADA. The effects are also larger in states with more ADA-related discrimination charges.},

Guided by socioemotional selectivity theory, this paper provides a comprehensive meta-analysis of the relationships of chronological age with the 35 job attitudes most frequently studied as its correlates. Results of meta-analyses from more than 800 articles indicate that the relationships between chronological age and favorable attitudes (and/or to less unfavorable attitudes) toward work tasks, colleagues and supervisors, and organizations are generally significant and weak to moderate in strength. Moderator analyses also revealed that organizational tenure, race, gender, education level, and publication year of study moderate the relationships between age and job attitudes. Based on these findings, we make recommendations for future theory development and empirical research on age in organizational settings. We also discuss the implications of our findings for practice. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We have designed and conducted an experiment to verify the existence of racial discrimination in the access to the credit market in Mexico. In particular, because of the nature of the experiment, we have concentrated on the first step of the credit application process, namely, the inquiry process. We hired three professional pairs of Mexican actors that consisted of one white, Spanish member and one dark-skinned, mestizo member. These pairs impersonated small entrepreneurs with the same qualities and creditworthiness. The actors visited close to 300 randomly selected commercial banking branches in Mexico City to apply for credit. The results provide evidence of discriminatory behavior against dark-skinned Mexicans even after controlling for features such as their creditworthiness, annual sales, and industry as well as loan officers' demographics and styles, among others.},

abstract = {Objective To demonstrate regression to the mean bias introduced by matching on preperiod variables in difference-in-differences studies. Data Sources Simulated data. Study Design We performed a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the effect of a placebo intervention on simulated longitudinal data for units in treatment and control groups using unmatched and matched difference-in-differences analyses. We varied the preperiod level and trend differences between the treatment and control groups, and the serial correlation of the matching variables. We assessed estimator bias as the mean absolute deviation of estimated program effects from the true value of zero. Principal Findings When preperiod outcome level is correlated with treatment assignment, an unmatched analysis is unbiased, but matching units on preperiod outcome levels produces biased estimates. The bias increases with greater preperiod level differences and weaker serial correlation in the outcome. This problem extends to matching on preperiod level of a time-varying covariate. When treatment assignment is correlated with preperiod trend only, the unmatched analysis is biased, and matching units on preperiod level or trend does not introduce additional bias. Conclusions Researchers should be aware of the threat of regression to the mean when constructing matched samples for difference-in-differences. We provide guidance on when to incorporate matching in this study design.},

abstract = {Purpose: Instrumental variable (IV) methods are used increasingly in pharmacoepidemiology to address unmeasured confounding. In this tutorial, we review the steps used in IV analyses and the underlying assumptions. We also present methods to assess the validity of those assumptions and describe sensitivity analysis to examine the effects of possible violations of those assumptions. Methods: Observational studies based on regression or propensity score analyses rely on the untestable assumption that there are no unmeasured confounders. IV analysis is a tool that removes the bias caused by unmeasured confounding provided that key assumptions (some of which are also untestable) are met. Results: When instruments are valid, IV methods provided unbiased treatment effect estimation in the presence of unmeasured confounders. However, the standard error of the IV estimate is higher than the standard error of non-IV estimates, e.g., regression and propensity score methods. Sensitivity analyses provided insight about the robustness of the IV results to the plausible degrees of violation of assumptions. Conclusions: IV analysis should be used cautiously because the validity of IV estimates relies on assumptions that are, in general, untestable and difficult to be certain about. Thus, assessing the sensitivity of the estimate to violations of these assumptions is important and can better inform the causal inferences that can be drawn from the study.

Surprisingly, higher unionization rates were associated with increased foreign direct investment. Overall, higher taxes deterred foreign direct investment; however, more extensive transportation infrastructures and larger promotional expenditures were associated with increased foreign direct investment.},

We examine characteristics of ADEA charges including the prevalence of different alleged discriminatory actions (or issues) and highlight the increasing proportion of age discrimination charges that are jointly filed with other antidiscrimination statutes. Through a regression analysis, we find that the likelihood of citing various issues differs by charging party characteristics, such as age, gender, and minority status, and on charges that cite only age discrimination as compared to those that are jointly filed.

We collected data on every interaction between presenters and their audience in hundreds of research seminars and job market talks across most leading economics departments, as well as during summer conferences. We find that women presenters are treated differently than their male counterparts. Women are asked more questions during a seminar and the questions asked of women presenters are more likely to be patronizing or hostile. These effects are not due to women presenting in different fields, different seminar series, or different topics, as our analysis controls for the institution, seminar series, and JEL codes associated with each presentation. Moreover, it appears that there are important differences by field and that these differences are not uniformly mitigated by more rigid seminar formats. Our findings add to an emerging literature documenting ways in which women economists are treated differently than men, and suggest yet another potential explanation for their under-representation at senior levels within the economics profession.},

Below we describe the 19 measures we have calculated, though we focus on only one per dimension, as described in Chapter 2.

However, little is known about whether gender nonconformity, as a visible marker of one's stigmatized status as a transgender individual, heightens trans people's experiences with discrimination and, in turn, their health. Using data from the largest survey of transgender adults in the United States, the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (N = 4,115), we examine the associations among gender nonconformity, transphobic discrimination, and health‐harming behaviors (i.e., attempted suicide, drug/alcohol abuse, and smoking). The results suggest that gender nonconforming trans people face more discrimination and, in turn, are more likely to engage in health‐harming behaviors than trans people who are gender conforming. Our findings highlight the important role of gender nonconformity in the social experiences and well‐being of transgender people. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

abstract = {Gender discrimination in accessing financial resources is a mounting concern in developing countries, but empirical evidence of such discrimination is limited. Using data collected from one of the largest peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms in China, we investigate potential gender discrimination in online P2P credit lending market in China. The results illustrate that female borrowers are more likely to be funded than male borrowers; but in exchange for higher funding success, female borrowers are found to pay higher interest rates. Moreover, the default rates of loans from female borrowers are significantly lower than those from male borrowers. Finally, we found that a borrower's gender moderates the relationships between the borrower' attributes and lending outcomes. The findings imply that profit-based statistical discrimination and costly taste-based discrimination co-exist in this online peer-to-peer lending market, but the underlying reasons for the discriminations are different. The implications for research and practice along with the limitations of this study are discussed accordingly.},

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

Recently, broader understandings of gender have influenced affirmative therapy with transgender clients. The pur-pose of the present research is to critically review historical views of transgender clients and to highlight experiences of transgender clients in therapy. Feminist phenomenology informed in-depth interviews with seven people who self-identify as transgender. Four themes emerged: the purposes transgender clients sought therapy, problems in practice, therapist reputation, and transgender affir-mative therapy. Transgender affirmative practice and training implications are discussed.},

We examine whether this racial bias is related to false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites (e.g., "black people's skin is thicker than white people's skin"). Study 1 documented these beliefs among white laypersons and revealed that participants who more strongly endorsed false beliefs about biological differences reported lower pain ratings for a black (vs. white) target. Study 2 extended these findings to the medical context and found that half of a sample of white medical students and residents endorsed these beliefs. Moreover, participants who endorsed these beliefs rated the black (vs. white) patient's pain as lower and made less accurate treatment recommendations. Participants who did not endorse these beliefs rated the black (vs. white) patient's pain as higher, but showed no bias in treatment recommendations. These findings suggest that individuals with at least some medical training hold and may use false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites to inform medical judgments, which may contribute to racial disparities in pain assessment and treatment.},

abstract = {Numerous studies regress log earnings on schooling and report estimated coefficients as "Mincer rates of return". A more recent literature uses instrumental variables. This chapter considers the economic interpretation of these analyses and how the availability of repeated cross section and panel data improves the ability of analysts to estimate the rate of return. We consider under what conditions the Mincer model estimates an ex post rate of return. We test and reject the model on six cross sections of U.S. Census data. We present a general nonparametric approach for estimating marginal internal rates of return that takes into account tuition, income taxes and forms of uncertainty. We also contrast estimates based on a single cross-section of data, using the synthetic cohort approach, with estimates based on repeated cross-sections following actual cohorts. Cohort-based models fitted on repeated cross section data provide more reliable estimates of ex post returns. Accounting for uncertainty affects estimates of rates of return. Accounting for sequential revelation of information calls into question the validity of the internal rate of return as a tool for policy analysis. An alternative approach to computing economic rates of return that accounts for sequential revelation of information is proposed and the evidence is summarized. We distinguish ex ante from ex post returns. New panel data methods for estimating the uncertainty and psychic costs facing agents are reviewed. We report recent evidence that demonstrates that there are large psychic costs of schooling. This helps to explain why persons do not attend school even though the financial rewards for doing so are high. We present methods for computing distributions of returns ex ante and ex post. We review the literature on instrumental variable estimation. The link of the estimates to the economics is not strong. The traditional instruments are weak, and this literature has not produced decisive empirical estimates. We exposit new methods that interpret the economic content of different instruments within a unified framework. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In both studies, participants evaluated application materials for a pair of same‐gender equally qualified job candidates who differed on parental status. The laboratory experiment found that mothers were penalized on a host of measures, including perceived competence and recommended starting salary. Men were not penalized for, and sometimes benefited from, being a parent. The audit study showed that actual employers discriminate against mothers, but not against fathers.

Exploiting differential timing in the announcements of restaurant and bar limitations, non-essential business closures, stay-at-home orders, large-gatherings bans, school closures, and emergency declarations, we leverage the high-frequency search data to separately identify the effects of multiple NPIs that were introduced around the same time. We then describe a set of assumptions under which proxy outcomes can be used to estimate a causal parameter of interest when data on the outcome of interest are limited. Using this method, we quantify the share of overall growth in unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic that was directly due to each of these state-level NPIs. We find that between March 14 and 28, restaurant and bar limitations and non-essential business closures can explain 6.0{\%} and 6.4{\%} of UI claims respectively, while the other NPIs did not directly increase own-state UI claims. This suggests that most of the short-run increase in UI claims during the pandemic was likely due to other factors, including declines in consumer demand, local policies, and policies implemented by private firms and institutions.},

This market has three interesting features: the existence of a detailed reviewing system, the high frequency of transactions and the panel dimension of the data. Using the fact that ratings provide potential guests with information about the quality of a listing, we build a credible measure of statistical discrimination, following a strategy a la ` Altonji and Pierret (2001). Hosts from a minority ethnic group charge 16{\%} less than other hosts in the same cities. Controlling for a rich set of characteristics reduces the ethnic price gap to 3.2{\%}. An additional review increases the daily price more for minority than for majority hosts. Estimating the parameters of a theoretical pricing model, we find that statistical discrimination accounts for most of the price differential: 2.5 percentage points.Keywords: ethnic discrimination, statistical discrimination, rental market JEL Classification: J15, L85},

abstract = {This article presents the findings of a study on age discrimination against older workers in Hong Kong. The study collected survey data from 787 older workers aged 45 or above and 283 employers who were managers responsible for personnel or human resources management, or for hiring people for organizations. The focus is on revealing the influences of the organizational goals of profit-making and social responsibility on age discrimination, along with influences from negative stereotyping and other factors. Results indicate that the social responsibility goal tends to be more influential than negative stereotyping on age discrimination. In contrast, the profit-making goal did not display a significant effect on age discrimination. They offer implications for policies and practices for managing the ageing workforce in the labour market.},

@article{Koch2008,
abstract = {Legal protection for transgender employees, where it exists at all, varies widely. A single federal circuit interprets Title VII as protecting transgender employees, but only when the employee is able to prove workplace stereotyping. Some state and local governments offer varying degrees of protection to transgender employees, but these statutes and ordinances are inconsistent, and often inappropriately attempt to graft transgender protection onto statutes and ordinances forbidding sexual orientation discrimination. One state protects transgender employees via its disability statute, but the federal disability statute explicitly excludes transgender employees, and in any event many transgender employees do not have (or want) a formal diagnosis of disability. This article argues that the definition of "sex" in federal, state, and local antidiscrimination laws should be expanded to include transgender. This approach is consistent with the sex-stereotyping theory of discrimination announced by the Supreme Court in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins. If a woman is discriminated against because she does not adhere to social stereotypes about what it means "to be a woman," then a transgender individual is discriminated against when he or she does not adhere to the social stereotypes about what it means to be a member of her or his biological sex. The proposed approach has four advantages. First, it would create consistency among the federal, state, and local governments concerning the meaning of "sex" and the protection extended to transgender employees. Second, it would extend coverage to the entire transgender community rather than the piecemeal protection currently in effect. Third, it would provide protection to transgender employees immediately. Fourth, courts would easily be able to fit transgender discrimination into an existing legal framework.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine what roles patient-provider and patient-staff racial concordance play on patients' perceptions within the health care setting. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Data from the Commonwealth Fund 2001 Quality of Care telephone survey. Analysis focused on the subsample of 6,066 adults who live in the continental United States and who reported having a regular provider or a usual source of care (n = 4,762). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We analyzed patients' responses about perceptions of disrespect, unfair treatment because of race and language, and the belief that he/she would have received better treatment if he/she belonged to a different race. We compared these perceptions of mistreatment with provider and staff racial concordance, controlling for sociodemographic variables. Contrary to our hypothesis, Hispanics were more likely to report being treated with disrespect if in a concordant relationship with their provider than if in a nonconcordant one (odds ratio [OR] 2.42, P {\textless} .01). Asians were less likely to report being treated unfairly because of race if in racially concordant relationships with providers than if in nonconcordant ones (P {\textless} .05). Hispanics were also less likely to perceive unfair treatment because of language when in concordant relationships with staff as compared to nonconcordant relationships with staff (P {\textless} .05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients' perceptions of health care relationships may partially depend on racial concordance with providers and staff. The nature of the association between racial concordance and perceived disrespect varies by racial group, indicating that other race-specific factors may also need to be examined.},

Both effects attenuate geographically. Theoretical research has identified many sources of agglomeration economies, including labour market pooling, input sharing, and knowledge spillovers. Empirical research has offered evidence consistent with each of these.},

This proportion remained constant across age, education level, income, religion, region, political affiliation, and race, but varied with gender and sexual orientation. Specifically, men (compared to women) and people who identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual (compared to those who identify as heterosexual) were more likely to report previous engagement in CNM.

Obese workers without employer-sponsored insurance do not have a wage offset relative to their non-obese counterparts. A substantial part of the lower wages among obese women attributed to labor market discrimination can be explained by their higher health insurance premiums. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Low-income adults without dependent children have historically had few paths to obtain public health insurance unless they qualified for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) cash benefits because of a disability. However, in states that expand their Medicaid programs, childless adults may obtain Medicaid without undergoing an intensive SSI disability review process and with substantially higher income and assets than the SSI program allows. This expanded availability of Medicaid coverage, independent of SSI participation, creates an opportunity to increase earnings and savings without jeopardizing health insurance coverage. In this paper, we use the natural experiments created by state decisions to expand Medicaid to nondisabled, nonelderly adults without dependent children to study the effect of decoupling Medicaid eligibility and cash assistance using a difference-in-differences study design. We collected data on the income eligibility limits, enrollment caps, and coverage characteristics of state Medicaid expansions to childless adults from 2001 to 2013. We combine these data with the nationally representative American Community Survey to estimate the effects of state expansion on SSI participation. We find relative declines in SSI participation of 0.17 percentage points on average after the introduction of Medicaid coverage for childless adults, a 7{\%} relative decrease. This finding suggests the potential for small but important efficiency gains from separating SSI and Medicaid eligibility.},

In this article, the authors offer basic results from the 2010 survey. "Chalk and talk" remains the dominant teaching style, but there were drops in mean (although not median) values for those pedagogies and some growth in the use of other methods, including class discussion and computer-generated displays. More instructors provided students with problem sets and class notes, and computer lab assignments were increasingly common in econometrics and statistics courses. Experiments are occasionally used in introductory courses but almost never used in other courses. Calculus is not viewed as important by a majority of instructors in any courses but is considered more important in intermediate theory and statistics and econometrics courses.

Methods: In 2003, we recruited through the Internet a sample of 1093 maleto-female and female-to-male transgender persons, stratified by gender. Participants completed an online survey that included standardized measures of mental health. Guided by the minority stress model, we evaluated associations between stigma and mental health and tested whether indicators of resilience (family support, peer support, identity pride) moderated these associations. Results: Respondents had a high prevalence of clinical depression (44.1{\%}), anxiety (33.2{\%}), and somatization (27.5{\%}). Social stigma was positively associated with psychological distress. Peer support (from other transgender people) moderated this relationship. We found few differences by gender identity. Conclusions: Our findings support the minority stress model. Prevention needs to confront social structures, norms, and attitudes that produce minority stress for gender-variant people; enhance peer support; and improve access to mental health and social services that affirm transgender identity and promote resilience.},

This topic is of interest because of a number of key stylized facts, including notably Zipf's law for cities (which states that the number of cities of size greater than S is proportional to 1/S) and the importance of urban primacy. We first review the empirical evidence on the upper tail of city size distribution. We offer a novel discussion of the important econometric issues in the characterization of the distribution. We then discuss the theories that have been advanced to explain the approximate constancy of the distribution across very different economic and social systems, emphasizing both barebone statistical theories and more developed economic theories. We discuss the more recent work on the determinants of urban growth and, in particular, growth regressions, economic explanations of city size distributions other than Gibrat's law, consequences of major shocks (quasi natural experiments), and the dynamics of U.S. urban evolution},

abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic crisis has rendered millions of U.S. households unable to pay rent, placing them at risk for eviction. Evictions may accelerate COVID-19 transmission by increasing household crowding and decreasing individuals' ability to comply with social distancing directives. We leveraged variation in the expiration of eviction moratoriums in U.S. states to test for associations between evictions and COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Methods: The study included 44 U.S. states that instituted eviction moratoriums., followed from March 13th to September 3rd, 2020. We modeled associations using a difference-in-difference approach with an event study specification. Negative binomial regression models of cases and deaths included fixed effects for state and week and controlled for time-varying indicators of testing, stay-at-home orders, school closures, and mask mandates. We then used model predictions to estimate cumulative cases and deaths associated with expiring eviction moratoriums. Findings: Twenty-seven states lifted eviction moratoriums during the study period. COVID-19 incidence in states that lifted their moratoriums was 1.6 (95{\%} CI 1.0,2.3) times the incidence of states that maintained their moratoriums at 10 weeks post-lifting and grew to a ratio of 2.1 (CI 1.1,3.9) at ≥16 weeks. Mortality in states that lifted their moratoriums was 1.6 (CI 1.2,2.3) times the mortality of states that maintained their moratoriums at 7 weeks post-lifting and grew to a ratio of 5.4 (CI 3.1,9.3) at ≥16 weeks. These results translate to an estimated 433,700 excess cases (CI 365200,502200) and 10,700 excess deaths (CI 8900,12500) nationally. Interpretation: Lifting eviction moratoriums was associated with increased COVID-19 incidence and mortality, supporting the public health rationale for use of eviction moratoriums to prevent the spread of COVID-19.},

To date, however, we know very little about the level of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the foster care system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical investigation to ask whether foster care agencies, the public, and nonprofit firms that facilitate foster care placements respond similarly to e-mails sent by fictitious same-sex and heterosexual couples who inquire about becoming foster parents. Our results suggest that, while foster care agencies respond at somewhat similar rates to gay male couples, gay female couples, and heterosexual couples, responses sent to gay males are of lower quality. Gay males receive much shorter responses that take longer to receive. Responses to gay male couples are also less likely to include essential information about the process of becoming a foster parent, such as details about informational sessions or being given an application. We do not find any evidence of differential treatment towards same-sex female couples.},

We establish that gender identity – in particular, an aversion to the wife earning more than the husband - impacts marriage formation, the wife's labor force participation, the wife's income conditional on working, marriage satisfaction, likelihood of divorce, and the division of home production. The distribution of the share of household income earned by the wife exhibits a sharp cliff at 0.5, which suggests that a couple is less willing to match if her income exceeds his. Within marriage markets, when a randomly chosen woman becomes more likely to earn more than a randomly chosen man, marriage rates decline. Within couples, if the wife's potential income (based on her demographics) is likely to exceed the husband's, the wife is less likely to be in the labor force and earns less than her potential if she does work.

Using a comprehensive administrative database from Clemson University, this study estimates the relationship between the incentives created by a South Carolina merit scholarship (LIFE) and students' academic performance. I hypothesize that being at risk of gaining or losing this scholarship will lead to increased effort and, as a consequence, higher grades. The results suggest that the incentives created by the scholarship increase GPAs by as much as 0.101 on a four-point scale, controlling for student and course characteristics. Moreover, the results indicate that for men the relationship between the risk of gaining or losing the scholarship and grades is large and statistically significant; for women, however, there is little evidence that the scholarship is related to grades.},

We examine the extent to which protest attendance and petition signing have diffused to different kinds of actors across multiple generations; we test claims central to understanding trends in social movement participation. Using aggregated, cross-sectional survey data on political involvement from 34,241 respondents, we examine changes in the probability of ever having attended a protest or signed a petition over time periods and across cohorts using cross-classified, random-effects models. We find a strong generational effect on the probability of ever having attended a protest, which explains much of the observed change in self-reports of protest behavior. More than half of this generational effect is a result of compositional change, but we find little evidence that protest attendance diffused to new types of actors. We compare these findings with a less confrontational form of protesting, petition signing, which shows more period than cohort effects. We argue that social movement activities have not become a widespread means of civic engagement. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2016. State and federal policymakers grappling with the aftermath of the Great Recession sought ways to spur job creation, in many cases adopting hiring credits to encourage employers to create new jobs. Virtually no evidence is available, however, on the effects of these kinds of counter-recessionary hiring credits, with the only evidence coming from much earlier studies of the federal New Jobs Tax Credit in the 1970s. This article provides evidence on the effects of state hiring credits on job growth. Some specific types of hiring credits—including those targeting the unemployed, those that allow states to recapture credits when job creation goals are not met, and refundable hiring credits—appear to have succeeded in boosting job growth, particularly during the Great Recession period and perhaps also during recessions in general. At the same time, some evidence suggests that these credits can generate much more hiring than net employment growth, consistent with the credits encouraging churning of employees that raises the cost of producing jobs through hiring credits.},

Results: Our results confirm that economic changes impinge on retirement expectations, but they also show stronger influences of other factors such as debts and the work environment. Implications: As the baby boom cohorts approach retirement age, it will be important to better understand how workers consider macro factors such as the state of the economy and firm-level factors and personal finances when planning for retirement. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author.},

abstract = {The classical instrumental-variables estimator is extremely sensitive to the presence of outliers in the sample. This is a concern because outliers can strongly distort the estimated effect of a given regressor on the dependent variable. Although outlier diagnostics exist, they frequently fail to detect atypical observations because they are themselves based on nonrobust (to outliers) estimators. Furthermore, they do not take into account the combined influence of outliers in the first and second stages of the instrumental-variables estimator. In this article, we present a robust instrumental-variables estimator, initially proposed by Cohen Freue, Ortiz-Molina, and Zamar (2011, Working paper: http://www.stat.ubc.ca/̃ruben/website/cv/cohen-zamar.pdf), that we have programmed in Stata and made available via the robivreg command. We have improved on their estimator in two different ways. First, we use a weighting scheme that makes our estimator more efficient and allows the computations of the usual identification and overidentifying restrictions tests. Second, we implement a generalized Hausman test for the presence of outliers. {\textcopyright} 2012 StataCorp LP.},

We use a difference-in-difference-in-differences strategy to compare older and younger workers, in states with stronger and weaker laws, before, during, and after the Great Recession. We find very little evidence that stronger age discrimination protections helped older workers weather the Great Recession, relative to younger workers. The evidence sometimes points in the opposite direction, with stronger state age discrimination protections associated with more adverse effects of the Great Recession on older workers. We suggest that during an experience such as the Great Recession, severe labor market disruptions make it difficult to discern discrimination, weakening the effects of stronger state age discrimination protections. Alternatively, higher termination costs associated with stronger age discrimination protections may do more to deter hiring when future product and labor demand is highly uncertain. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.},

Although this method provides strong causal evidence of racial/ethnic discrimination, these claims depend on the signal being clearly conveyed through names.

The author conducts a survey experiment in which respondents are asked to identify the races or ethnicities they associate with a series of names. Respondents are provided with combinations of Hispanic and Anglo first and last names. Hispanic first names paired with Anglo last names are least likely to be recognized as Hispanic, while all versions of Hispanic first and last names are highly recognized (≥90 percent). The results suggest that researchers must use caution when trying to signal Hispanic ethnicity in experiments, and prior findings from correspondence audits may be biased from poor signals.},

abstract = {This article focuses on cities with unprecedented economic success and a seemingly permanent crisis of affordable housing. In the expensive cities, policymakers expend great amounts of energy trying to bring down housing costs with subsidies for affordable housing and sometimes with rent control. But these efforts are undermined by planning decisions that make housing for most people vastly more expensive than it has to be by restricting the supply of new units even in the face of growing demand. I begin by describing current housing policy in the expensive metro areas of the United States. I then show how this combination of policies affecting housing, despite internal contradictions, makes sense from the perspective of the political coalitions that can form in a setting of fragmented local jurisdictions, local control over land use policies, and homeowner control over local government. Finally, I propose some more effective approaches to housing policy. My view is that the effects of the formal affordable housing policies of expensive cities are quite small in their impact when compared to the size of the problem—like sand castles before the tide. I will argue that we can do more, potentially much more, to create subsidized affordable housing in high-cost American cities. But more fundamentally, we will need to rethink the broader set of exclusionary land use policies that are the primary reason that housing in these cities has become so expensive. We cannot solve the problem unless we fix the housing market itself.},

The findings show evidence of substantial discrimination against Muslims and atheists on a par with, and sometimes larger than, the racial discrimination found in previous studies.

By combining data from bilateral negotiations in the Sportscard market with complementary field experiments, this study provides a framework that amends this shortcoming. The experimental design, which includes data gathered from more than 1100 market participants, provides sharp findings: (i) there is a strong tendency for minorities to receive initial and final offers that are inferior to those received by majorities, and (ii) overall, the data indicate that the observed discrimination is not due to animus, but represents statistical discrimination.},

In the German two-tier system, outpatient reimbursement rates for both public and private insurance are centrally determined but are significantly higher for the privately insured. In our field experiment, following a standardized protocol, the same hypothetical patient called 991 private practices in 36 German counties to schedule appointments for allergy tests, hearing tests and gastroscopies. Practices were 4{\%} more likely to offer an appointment to the privately insured. Conditional on being offered an appointment, wait times for the publicly insured were twice as long than for the privately insured. We also find smaller access differences when reimbursement rate differences are smaller. Our findings show that structural differences in reimbursement rates lead to structural differences in health care access.},

Operational definitions of key concepts such as turn- out and election closeness are often inconsistent and limited in application to two-party systems. This paper provides a more generalized test of the turnout-competition link in electoral districts. Data are 1993 and 1997 constituency-level election results for the Canadian House of Commons. Canada provides an excellent case for comparison because it has single-member districts, plurality elections, both national and regional parties, and multiparty competition throughout the nation. Several alternative measures for “turnout” and “closeness” are evaluated in the context of multi- party elections. A new index of competitiveness is developed. Multicandidate measures of close- ness are related to higher levels of voter participation in Canadian federal elections.},

This approach, combined with interaction terms that capture different program implementation periods, is an attempt to enhance the current understanding of scholarship programs on college enrollment. The results suggest that these programs have a significant impact on college enrollment after controlling for state-level factors, but the effect depends on when the program was implemented, who is eligible to receive aid, and how much aid these students are awarded.},

abstract = {Empirical research on cities starts with a spatial equilibrium condition: workers and firms are assumed to be indifferent across space. This condition implies that research on cities is different from research on countries, and that work on places within countries needs to consider population, income, and housing prices simultaneously. Housing supply elasticity will determine whether urban success reveals itself in the form of more people or higher incomes. Urban economists generally accept the existence of agglomeration economies, which exist when productivity rises with density, but estimating the magnitude of those economies is difficult. Some manufacturing firms cluster to reduce the costs of moving goods, but this force no longer appears to be important in driving urban success. Instead, modern cities are far more dependent on the role that density can play in speeding the flow of ideas. Finally, urban economics has some insights to offer related topics such as growth theory, national income accounts, public economics, and housing prices. (JEL R11, R23, R31, R32)},

Although audits use distinctive names to signal race, few studies scientifically examine data regarding the perception of race from names. Different names treated as black or white may be perceived in heterogeneous ways. I conduct a survey experiment that asks respondents to identify the race they associate with a series of names. I alter the first names given to each respondent and inclusion of last names. Names more commonly given by highly educated black mothers (e.g., Jalen and Nia) are less likely to be perceived as black than names given by less educated black mothers (e.g., DaShawn and Tanisha). The results suggest that a large body of social science evidence on racial discrimination operates under a misguided assumption that all black names are alike, and the findings from correspondence audits are likely sensitive to name selection.},

Here we provide illustrative evidence on the health consequences of stigma and present a conceptual framework describing the psychological and structural pathways through which stigma influences health. Because of its pervasiveness, its disruption of multiple life domains (e.g., resources, social relationships, and coping behaviors), and its corrosive impact on the health of populations, stigma should be considered alongside the other major organizing concepts for research on social determinants of population health.},

abstract = {The literature on the impact of immigration on the labor market is highly controversial. The aim of this paper is to review the existing literature and draw some general conclusions on how wages and employment respond to immigration. Economic studies indicate that the impact of immigration on the average wage and employment of native workers is null or slightly positive. However, because adjustments take time, the immediate labor market effects of unexpected (as opposed to expected) migration episodes can be detrimental. Immigration also can have distributional consequences. In particular, the skill composition of immigrants matters in determining their impact on native labor market outcomes. An inflow of immigrants will tend to reduce the wages of competing native workers (with skills similar to those of the migrants), and increase those of complementary workers (with skills that complement those of immigrants). By affecting the skill composition of the workforce, immigration can create winners and losers among native workers via changes in the wage structure.},

We re-examine this issue and show there is a tendency to underestimate the concentration index at an increasing rate when lowering the number of income categories. This tendency arises due to a form of measurement error and we propose two correction methods. Firstly, the use of instrumental variables (IV) can reduce the error within income categories. Secondly, through a simple formula for correction that is based only on the number of groups. We find that the simple correction formula reduces the impact of grouping and always outperforms the IV approach. Use of this correction can substantially improve comparisons of the concentration index both across countries and across time. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little information is available regarding physicians' sex as a potential bias in making pain treatment decisions. This study investigated how sex of the medical care provider and patient characteristics influence choices that are made in the treatment of low back pain. METHODS: Data of 186 charts of patients with low back pain (46{\%} males) who were seen by trained residents were analyzed in this retrospective observational study. The primary outcome was the first treatment choice that was made, which was categorized in three groups: pharmacological therapy; invasive procedures; or other options at the time of first consultation. Chi-square statistics and multinominal logistic regression analysis were used to examine associations between physicians' and/or patients' sex and treatment choices. RESULTS: Physicians' sex was found to be a significant predictor of the first decision that was made in the treatment of low back pain. Female physicians tended to prescribe more pharmacological agents as their first treatment choice. No significant sex differences were found for invasive therapies or other treatment options as a first choice. These findings were found to be independent from previous received pain therapies before consultation by the specialized pain clinician. Further, patients' sex did not influence decisions on pain management nor did gender concordance or discordance in the patient-physician relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians' sex had a significant impact on pain management decisions in patients with low back pain. Female physicians prescribed more pharmacological agents as their first choice compared to male physicians.},

We suggest novel two-step estimators that allow the covariates to enter the model in a very flexible form. In particular, the first stages can be estimated using supervised machine learning methods. We derive asymptotic results for new semiparametric and linear model based estimators for repeated cross-sections and panel data and show that they have desirable statistical properties like asymptotic normality and double robustness. Further, we establish semiparametric efficiency bounds for difference-in-differences estimation with cross-sectional and panel data. The proposed semiparametric estimators attain the bounds. The usability of the methods is assessed by replicating a study on an employment protection reform. We demonstrate that the notion of high-dimensional common trend confounding has implications for the economic interpretation of the policy evaluation results. Notably, measured reform effects are substantially decreased or even reversed when covariates are included in a data-driven manner.},

The retirement wealth of people aged 53-58 in 2006 declined by a relatively modest 2.8 percent by 2010. Relative losses were greatest among those with the highest wealth when the recession began. Most of the loss in wealth is due to a declining net value of housing, but several factors may provide this cohort with time to recover its housing losses. Although unemployment rose during the Great Recession, that increase was not mirrored by flows out of full-time work or partial retirement. To date, the retirement behavior of the Early Boomer cohort does not differ much from that of older cohorts at comparable ages.},

In addition, experimental research has demonstrated that activating positive self-relevant stereotypes (e.g., for men, the stereotype that men are good at math) can stimulate increases in promotion orientation. Integrating and applying this research to the work context, we hypothesized that the relationship between age and promotion orientation would depend on employees' perceptions of the stereotype of older workers in their work context, such that there would be no negative relationship between age and promotion orientation when individuals perceive a more positive older worker stereotype. METHOD: We analyzed the relationships between age, perceived older worker stereotype (POWS), and promotion orientation using a sample of working adults (N = 337) aged 19-64 years. RESULTS: Results revealed a significant age by POWS interaction such that there was a negative relationship between age and promotion orientation when POWS was less positive. However, there was no relationship between age and promotion orientation when POWS was more positive. DISCUSSION: Results suggest that the negative relationship between age and promotion orientation depends on contextual factors such as POWS.},

abstract = {This paper examines the effects of a generous, spatially targeted economic development policy (the federal Empowerment Zone program) on local neighborhood characteristics and on the neighborhood quality of life, taking into account the interactions amongst the policy, changes in neighborhood demographics and neighborhood housing stock. Urban economic theory posits that housing prices in a small area should increase as quality of life increases, because people will be willing to pay more to live in the area, but these changes in prices and quality of life will also affect the demographics of the population through sorting and the housing stock through reinvestment. Using census block-group level data, we examine how housing prices respond to the Empowerment Zone policy intervention. Changes in the other dimensions of neighborhood quality (demographics and housing stock characteristics) will also help determine the total - or full - effect on housing values of the policy intervention. This paper estimates these direct and full effects in a simultaneous equations setting, compares direct and indirect effects and examines the robustness of the effects to alternate estimation strategies. We find strong evidence for substantively large and highly significant direct price effects, while results suggest that the indirect effects are substantively small or even negative. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

American Indian lands are held in trust by the US Federal government and may not be used as collateral. We exploit the uniform and equal distribution of land between the Agua Caliente tribe and non-Indians in Palm Springs, CA in our analysis. Due to the General Allotment Act of 1887, the land was divided in a checkerboard pattern with even-numbered parcels provided to Agua Caliente government or individual tribal members and odd-numbered parcels (held in fee-simple status) were sold to non-Indians. Because of this, we overcome the usual land quality selection problem between the two types of property institutions. We find that holding local amenities and other characteristics of the parcel constant, there is no difference in the level of business investment on trust and fee simple properties. These results indicate that the inability to use American Indian land as collateral does not drive the low levels of observed business investment; other mechanisms and institutions may be the culprit. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine rural versus non-rural differences in the following risk factors among sexual minority adults: victimization/discrimination, fundamental religiosity, identification and involvement in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community, social support, and level of comfort disclosing sexual identity to others. The study recruited sexual minority individuals via online communications to LGBT organizations. Of the total sample (N = 699), 23.3{\%} resided in rural areas and 76.7{\%} resided in non-rural areas. A MANCOVA was conducted to determine if there was a significant overall relation of rural versus non-rural location to the five risk factors of interests, while controlling for age, sex, race, relationship status, and sexual identity. Post hoc ANCOVAs were then conducted to explore the specific directionality of the significant differences. Results revealed rural sexual minorities reported greater identification with fundamental religious beliefs, less comfort in disclosing their sexual identity to others, more experiences of victimization and discrimination, less identification with and involvement in the LGBT community, and less perceived social support when compared to their non-rural counterparts. These findings suggest sexual minorities residing in rural areas may experience increased exposure to negative risk factors. Implications for mental health providers working with rural sexual minorities are discussed.},

We capture aggregate patterns of the social milieu and the geographical form it takes. We use a unique data set, Getty Images and geo-coded over 6000 events and 300,000 photographic images taken in Los Angeles and New York City, and conducted GIS and spatial statistics to analyze macro-geographical patterns. The five important findings include: (i) social milieus have nonrandom spatial clustering; (ii) these clustering tendencies may reinforce themselves; (iii) event enclaves demonstrate homogeneous spatial patterns across all cultural industries; (iv) the recursive nature of place branding may partially explain resulting cultural hubs; and (v) the media also clusters. These results have unintended consequences for our understanding of clustering more generally and place branding. The use of Getty data provides a new spatial dimension through which to understand cultural industries and city geographic patterns.},

However, little research has delved into why these job candidates face discrimination. Therefore, we have conducted an online scenario experiment involving recruiters to empirically investigate 15 potential stigmas related to older age drawn from a systematic review of the literature. We found that older age particularly signals to recruiters that the applicant has lower technological skills, flexibility, and trainability levels. Together, these perceptions explain about 41{\%} of the effect of age on the probability of being invited to a job interview. Additionally, we found that the negative association between age and the invitation to interview probability is smaller when recruiters work for firms with a higher percentage of older employees.},

Because we do not have a good intrumental variable for Catholic school attendance, we develop new estimation methods based on the idea that the amount of selection on the observed explanatory variables in a model provided a guide to the amount of selection on the unobservables. We also propose an informal way to assess selectivity bias based on measuring the ratio of selection on unobservables to selection on observables that would be required if one is to attribute the entire effect of Catholic school attendance to selection bias. We use our methods to estimate the effect of attending a Catholic high school on a variety of outcomes. Our main conclusion is that Catholic high schools substantially increase the probability of graduating from high school and, more tentatively, attending college. We find little evidence of an effect on test scores. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Scholars argue about whether age stereotypes (beliefs about old people) are becoming more negative or positive over time. No previous study has systematically tested the trend of age stereotypes over more than 20 years, due to lack of suitable data. Our aim was to fill this gap by investigating whether age stereotypes have changed over the last two centuries and, if so, what may be associated with this change. We hypothesized that age stereotypes have increased in negativity due, in part, to the increasing medicalization of aging. This study applied computational linguistics to the recently compiled Corpus of Historical American English (COHA), a database of 400 million words that includes a range of printed sources from 1810 to 2009. After generating a comprehensive list of synonyms for the term elderly for these years from two historical thesauri, we identified 100 collocates (words that co-occurred most frequently with these synonyms) for each of the 20 decades. Inclusion criteria for the collocates were: (1) appeared within four words of the elderly synonym, (2) referred to an old person, and (3) had a stronger association with the elderly synonym than other words appearing in the database for that decade. This yielded 13,100 collocates that were rated for negativity and medicalization. We found that age stereotypes have become more negative in a linear way over 200 years. In 1880, age stereotypes switched from being positive to being negative. In addition, support was found for two potential explanations. Medicalization of aging and the growing proportion of the population over the age of 65 were both significantly associated with the increase in negative age stereotypes. The upward trajectory of age-stereotype negativity makes a case for remedial action on a societal level.},

abstract = {To understand the persistence of racial disparities across multiple domains (e.g., residential location, schooling, employment, health, housing, credit, and justice) and to develop effective remedies, we must recognize that these domains are reciprocally related and comprise an integrated system. The limited long-run success of government social policies to advance racial justice is due in part to the ad hoc nature of policy responses to various forms of racial discrimination. Drawing on a systems perspective, I show that race discrimination is a system whose emergent properties reinforce the effects of their components. The emergent property of a system of race-linked disparities is {\"{u}}ber discrimination - a meta-level phenomenon that shapes our culture, cognitions, and institutions, thereby distorting whether and how we perceive and make sense of racial disparities. Viewing within-domain disparities as part of a discrimination system requires better-specified analytic models. While the existence of an emergent system of {\"{u}}ber discrimination increases the difficulty of eliminating racial disparities, a systems perspective points to strategies to attack that system. These include identifying and intervening at leverage points, implementing interventions to operate simultaneously across subsystems, isolating subsystems from the larger discrimination system, and directly challenging the processes through which emergent discrimination strengthens within-subsystem disparities.},

Does it make sense to rebuild homes along the seashore after a hurricane? How good are the predictions for storm surges? Should we sign a lease for hydrofracking on our property? What are the risks to our drinking water? Science is, potentially, the best source for the evidence needed to answer these questions. Realizing that potential will require effective two-way communication with those whom science hopes to serve–so that it produces relevant information and conveys it in a credible, comprehensible form. This special issue of PNAS presents scientific foundations for that communication.

Its contributions recognize that communication about science does not occur in a vacuum. At the individual level, its success depends on the beliefs that individuals bring to it, such that some scientific results are difficult to comprehend whereas others go without saying. In some cases, communication just needs to fill the gaps in laypeople's mental models. In other cases, it needs to overcome misconceptions, sometimes the product of clumsy communication, sometimes the result of effective disinformation campaigns. Learning what laypeople know and need to know requires empirical research.

At the social level, the success of scientists' communication depends on their awareness of the role that their work plays in the public discourse. Although scientists may know more than anyone about the facts and uncertainties, applications of that science can raise complex ethical, legal, and social questions, regarding which reasonable people may disagree.

Its facile and safe access to the fetal circulation has broadened the spectrum of congenital disorders diagnosed prenatally. Some fetal disease states can now be identified and treated earlier, directly, more quickly, and more effectively than before, resulting in improved patient care. Although cordocentesis has been embraced by the perinatal community, it is, by definition, a technique of obtaining a fetal blood sample. A prerequisite for the procedure to exert its full impact on perinatal care is a highly capable clinical laboratory. The facility must be aware of the commonly requested fetal serologic, hematologic, and serum chemistry studies, as well as their normal values. Efforts must be made to perform fetal blood studies rapidly and reliably on small specimens. Laboratory personnel should be familiar with the indications and pitfalls of these tests and those that are best referred to a specialty laboratory. A general understanding of the perinatologist's needs and concerns will lead to a cooperative working relationship between clinician and laboratory. In this manner, we will truly discover what can be learned from cordocentesis.},

Indeed, journalists uncovered widespread evidence of such masking among Texas Highway troopers from 2010 to 2015. I propose a new test of racial bias in the presence of masking that is more powerful than standard tests and is well-suited to explore the rich heterogeneity in bias. Using various data-driven techniques to detect masking, I estimate that 24{\%} of 130,240 searches were masked, with over half being Hispanic drivers being mis-recorded as white when searches failed to turn up contraband. I find that Hispanic and white troopers are biased against non-white motorists, with Hispanic motorists being treated the most unfairly. Using my model, I also find evidence of institutional racial bias and 'bad apple' troopers across Texas.},

I show that existing evidence suggesting large effects of divorce laws on divorce rates reflect a failure to explicitly model the dynamic response of divorce rates to a shock to the legal regime. When accounting for these dynamics, I find that unilateral divorced spiked following the adoption of universal divorce laws, but that this rise largely reversed itself within a decade. Overall, these changes in family law explain very little of the rise in divorce over the past half-century. (JEL C78, J12). [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Demand estimates are used to compute price-cost margins for retailers and manufacturers under different supply models when wholesale prices are not observed. The purpose is to identify the set of margins compatible with the margins obtained from estimates of cost and to select the model most consistent with the data among non-nested competing models. The models considered are (1) a simple linear pricing model; (2) a vertically integrated model; and (3) a variety of alternative (strategic) supply scenarios that allow for collusion, non-linear pricing, and strategic behaviour with respect to private label products. Using data on yogurt sold in several stores in a large urban area of the U.S. the results imply that wholesale prices are close to marginal cost and that retailers have pricing power in the vertical chain. This is consistent with non-linear pricing by the manufacturers or high bargaining power of the retailers.},

abstract = {By analysing the Arts Council England survey of 13,300 respondents in 2001-2004 I take snapshots of the space of cultural consumption and map its social stratification. Mirroring a redrawn image of Americans' cultural consumption in the early 1990s, the emergent image in the UK exhibits evidence of division within the omnivores. The image and division raise questions about the omnivore-univore thesis and existing literature on cultural consumption. The findings also show that contrary to some recent studies, cultural consumption continues to be structured by social class. Most intriguing, however, is the result that culture is seen by avid cultural omnivores to be hierarchical. The received understanding of omnivores as tolerant and possessing inclusive tastes across culture hierarchy (consuming high, middle and low brow cultures), therefore, diverges from evidence of both division within and culture hierarchy perceived by the omnivores. The apparent divergence can be resolved by acknowledging that the concept of omnivores as those whose tastes are inclusive pre-supposes and guarantees the existence of culture hierarchy.

abstract = {Online labor markets have great potential as platforms for conducting experiments. They provide immediate access to a large and diverse subject pool, and allow researchers to control the experimental context. Online experiments, we show, can be just as valid-both internally and externally-as laboratory and field experiments, while often requiring far less money and time to design and conduct. To demonstrate their value, we use an online labor market to replicate three classic experiments. The first finds quantitative agreement between levels of cooperation in a prisoner's dilemma played online and in the physical laboratory. The second shows-consistent with behavior in the traditional laboratory-that online subjects respond to priming by altering their choices. The third demonstrates that when an identical decision is framed differently, individuals reverse their choice, thus replicating a famed Tversky-Kahneman result. Then we conduct a field experiment showing that workers have upward-sloping labor supply curves. Finally, we analyze the challenges to online experiments, proposing methods to cope with the unique threats to validity in an online setting, and examining the conceptual issues surrounding the external validity of online results. We conclude by presenting our views on the potential role that online experiments can play within the social sciences, and then recommend software development priorities and best practices. {\textcopyright} 2011 Economic Science Association.},

abstract = {The sharp regression discontinuity design (RDD) has three key weaknesses compared to the randomized clinical trial (RCT). It has lower statistical power, it is more dependent on statistical modeling assumptions, and its treatment effect estimates are limited to the narrow subpopulation of cases immediately around the cutoff, which is rarely of direct scientific or policy interest. This paper examines how adding an untreated comparison to the basic RDD structure can mitigate these three problems. In the example we present, pretest observations on the posttest outcome measure are used to form a comparison RDD function. To assess its performance as a supplement to the basic RDD, we designed a within-study comparison that compares causal estimates and their standard errors for (1) the basic posttest-only RDD, (2) a pretest-supplemented RDD, and (3) an RCT chosen to serve as the causal benchmark. The two RDD designs are constructed from the RCT, and all analyses are replicated with three different assignment cutoffs in three American states. The results show that adding the pretest makes functional form assumptions more transparent. It also produces causal estimates that are more precise than in the posttest-only RDD, but that are nonetheless larger than in the RCT. Neither RDD version shows much bias at the cutoff, and the pretest-supplemented RDD produces causal effects in the region beyond the cutoff that are very similar to the RCT estimates for that same region. Thus, the pretest-supplemented RDD improves on the standard RDD in multiple ways that bring causal estimates and their standard errors closer to those of an RCT, not just at the cutoff, but also away from it. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.},

Compared to other methods tackling factor models such as synthetic controls and matrix completion, our method does not require the number of time periods to grow infinitely. Instead, we draw inspiration from the two-way fixed effect model as a special case of the linear factor model, where a simple difference-in-differences transformation identifies the effect. We show that analogous, albeit more complex, transformations exist in the more general linear factor model, providing a new means to identify the effect in that model. In fact many such transformations exist, called bridge functions, all identifying the same causal effect estimand. This poses a unique challenge for estimation and inference, which we solve by targeting the minimal bridge function using a regularized estimation approach. We prove that our resulting average causal effect estimator is root-N consistent and asymptotically normal, and we provide asymptotically valid confidence intervals. Finally, we provide extensions for the case of a linear factor model with time-varying unmeasured confounders.},

Two-thirds of older women in the US receive spouse or widow Social Security benefits. These benefits generally require recipients to be currently married or to have had a ten-year marriage. Declining marriage rates, coupled with shorter marriages, dramatically change the distributional impact of these benefits on each cohort as they become eligible for Social Security. This paper uses June 1985, 1990, and 1995 CPS supplemental data to trace the decline in marital rates for women from five birth cohorts. We find that the proportion of persons who will be eligible as spouses or widows is decreasing modestly for whites and Hispanics, but dramatically for African Americans. This growing race gap in marital rates suggests that older black women will be particularly unlikely to qualify for these benefits.},

It is found that OLS and IV estimates of class size effects have perverse signs: both yield a positive coefficient on the class size variable. The results suggest that reduction in class size in secondary grades is not efficient in a developing country like Bangladesh.

To accomplish this, the author presents 3 questions for psychologists to ask: Who is included within this category? What role does inequality play? Where are there similarities? The 1st question involves attending to diversity within social categories. The 2nd conceptualizes social categories as connoting hierarchies of privilege and power that structure social and material life. The 3rd looks for commonalities across categories commonly viewed as deeply different.

Globally over 70{\%} of young people and adults with mental illness receive no treatment from healthcare staff. The rates of non-treatment are far higher in low income countries. Evidence from some descriptive studies and epidemiological surveys suggest that potent factors increasing the likelihood of treatment avoidance, or long delays before presenting for care include: (i) lack of knowledge about the features and treatability of mental illnesses; (ii) ignorance about how to access assessment and treatment; (iii) prejudice against people who have mental illness, and (iv) expectations of discrimination against people who have a diagnosis of mental illness. The associations between low rates of help seeking, and stigma and discrimination are as yet poorly understood and require more careful characterisation and analysis, providing the platform for more effective action to ensure that a greater proportion of people with mental illness are effectively treated in future.},

The investigation is conducted within the fixed effects panel regression framework using a balanced panel for ten Canadian provinces spanning the years 1981–2004. The estimated own price elasticities indicate that increased government taxation is an effective tool for curtailing the consumption of spirits (at the expense of lower government tax revenue), but it is less effective for curtailing the consumption of wine or beer. The cross-price elasticity estimates reveal that taxing beer or spirits may not be an effective tool for encouraging consumption switch from these alcoholic beverages to wine in light of wine's greater health benefits. Income emerges as an important determinant of the consumption of both wine and spirits but not of beer, whereas unemployment emerges as an important determinant of the consumption of beer but not of wine or spirits. With respect to unemployment, we find no support for the addiction hypothesis in the case of wine and spirits and strong support for the severe budget constraint hypothesis in the case of beer.},

abstract = {Audit studies have found employment discrimination in a variety of contexts. In Mexico, an overlooked aspect of this discrimination is that job advertisements usually include explicit criteria of gender, age, attractiveness, or require a photograph in the resume. These specifications, which we refer to as "explicit discrimination," may affect which applicants receive responses. We pose two hypotheses. First, a reduction in matching costs may result in a higher callback rate from explicitly discriminating employers. Second, discrimination in the first stage of the hiring process could lead to other discrimination patterns in later stages. We test for such biases using a correspondence experiment, in which fictitious resumes with randomized applicant information were sent in response to job advertisements in Mexico City. Consistent with our first hypothesis, employers with explicitly discriminatory ads are 8.2 percentage points more likely to call at least one female candidate for an interview than ads without explicit discrimination. With respect to our second hypothesis, the probability of a callback is close to 20 percentage points lower for married women responding to ads specifically targeted to women than for those responding to neutral ads. With respect to race, we find that only ads that include two or more discriminatory criteria resulted in a higher callback probability for white or mestizo women than for indigenous women or women with no photograph in their resumes. We find no economically significant results for men. Thus, although there is a higher callback rate from discriminatory ads, there is also exacerbated discriminatory behavior from employers, producing for some groups a type of double discrimination in the hiring process.},

abstract = {Based on a field experiment conducted in Germany between October 2014 and October 2015, this article focuses on the disadvantages associated with the presence of a foreign accent in the early hiring process, when applicants call in response to a job advertisement to ask whether the position is still available. We examine whether a foreign accent influences employers' behaviors via productivity considerations and/or whether foreign-accented speech is related to statistical discrimination or tastes among employers or customers that translate into differential treatment. To address these processes, we supplement our field-experimental data with information on job and firm characteristics from the texts of vacancy announcements and advertising companies' homepages, on labor supply from the Federal Employment Agency, and on anti-immigrant attitudes from the German General Social Survey. Results suggest that while calling with a Turkish name did not result in a lower rate of positive replies, this rate was reduced for candidates who called with a Turkish accent. Turkish-accented applicants were told more often than the advertised position was already filled. Our findings suggest that the difference in response rates was not due to productivity considerations related to how well individuals understood foreign-accented speakers. Instead, results support the notion that the observed disadvantages were linked to discrimination based on employers' ethnic tastes. While we found no indications pointing to the relevance of customer tastes or statistical discrimination, we cannot rule out these processes altogether. Our findings demonstrate that language cues can be more relevant than applicants' names in shaping employers' initial responses. They, thereby, highlight the need to consider multiple ethnic cues and different stages of the hiring process.},

abstract = {Timely reporting of mammogram results helps to reduce anxiety for women with negative results and speeds up diagnosis or treatment in the case of abnormal results. The goal of this project was to improve the rate at which Virginia mammography centers provide a written report to women in lay terms within 30 days of a mammogram. The project included six intervention and five control mammography centers. The baseline period was prior to when new regulations in the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) took effect in April 1999. The re-measurement period was after April 1999. Data were obtained from abstraction of mammography reports and patient notification letters from a sample of patients with negative and abnormal mammography results at each mammography center. Each intervention mammography center received a notebook that included numerous tools on systems for patient notification and tracking, baseline notification rates and other abstracted information, biopsy recommendations, sample results letters, and a copy of the MQSA. For negative mammograms, the intervention group in aggregate increased from 24{\%} at baseline to 79{\%} at re-measurement in their rate of notification within 30 days. The control group increased from 25{\%} to 46{\%}. For abnormal mammograms, increases were from 35{\%} to 85{\%} and from 25{\%} to 58{\%}, respectively. The intervention group's increases were considerably higher, suggesting an effect due to the interventions that involved technical assistance, education, and system change. All increases were statistically significant (p {\textless} 0.01). At baseline, three intervention centers and two controls had policies for written notification. All 11 had policies at re-measurement. However, only two of the five control centers could provide clear supporting documentation for dates of notification at re-measurement. Mammography centers can benefit from guidance in the form of intervention materials specifically designed to address the MQSA sections that apply to patient notification, tracking, and positive predictive value of biopsy recommendations.},

abstract = {Numerous empirical studies employ regression discontinuity designs with multiple cutoffs and heterogeneous treatments. A common practice is to normalize all the cutoffs to zero and estimate one effect. This procedure identifies the average treatment effect (ATE) on the observed distribution of individuals local to existing cutoffs. However, researchers often want to make inferences on more meaningful ATEs, computed over general counterfactual distributions of individuals, rather than simply the observed distribution of individuals local to existing cutoffs. This paper proposes a consistent and asymptotically normal estimator for such ATEs when heterogeneity follows a non-parametric function of cutoff characteristics in the sharp case. The proposed estimator converges at the minimax optimal rate of root-n for a specific choice of tuning parameters. Identification in the fuzzy case, with multiple cutoffs, is impossible unless heterogeneity follows a finite-dimensional function of cutoff characteristics. Under parametric heterogeneity, this paper proposes an ATE estimator for the fuzzy case that optimally combines observations to maximize its precision.},

But price differences only emerge for sellers who have low eBay feedback scores in less competitive markets. Because the price differences dissipate as sellers accumulate credible reputations, the patterns in the data are indicative of statistical discrimination. Overall, the results suggest that mechanisms designed to reduce informational asymmetries and increased competition are both effective at reducing discrimination in online auctions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Mandating education substantially increased adult income and substantially decreased the likelihood of being below the low-income cut-off unemployed, and in a manual occupation.

The model of household specialization and division of labor introduced by Becker posits that when forming households, couples will exploit the gains from trade by having one spouse specialize in market work while the other specializes in household work. Given the historical advantage of men in the labor market, the model predicts specialization by gender and therefore an earnings advantage for married men and an earnings disadvantage for married women. Is this model of specialization useful for understanding the evolution of the gender gap across generations of women? And what about children? Academic papers have shown that wages of mothers are significantly lower than those of non-mothers with similar human capital characteristics. We do not attempt to build a structural model here, but rather document how changing associations between marriage and earnings, and between children and earnings, have contributed to the gender gap in an "accounting" sense.},

Explores the various stages of the employment relationship: recruitment and selection, performance and evaluation, training and career development, and exit from the organization. Highlights current research related to each stage of employment. Argues that the role of culture in understanding issues of age and aging in organizations has been understudied and underdeveloped. Suggests that older worker stereotypes are ubiquitous and share a number of similarities across a variety of countries: older workers are consistently perceived as more dependable and reliable, more difficult to train, and less adaptable. Notes, however, that older workers face more obstacles in recruitment and selection than younger workers. Makes 3 general observations and discusses their implications for future research and theoretical development: there is no single theoretical framework that has been proposed to explain the role of age in employment outcomes and behavior; there is a trend, particularly in U.S.-based research, to explore the contexts in which age plays a greater and lesser role in employment outcomes; and research tends to address individual biases, such as age, gender, and race, in isolation, but there is evidence that an individual's age may interact with other demographic characteristics to influence employment outcomes.

Changes in the likelihood of becoming disabled and the likelihood of recovering from disability also are investigated with the LSOA. There is some evidence for improving disability status among the old. The prevalence of disability is somewhat lower in more recent years in the NHIS; also, the incidence of disability is lower, and the rate of recovery higher during 1988-90 than in the 1984-86 interval. On the other hand, the prevalence of disability increases at some dates after 1984 in the LSOA sample. In both datasets, there is fluctuation rather than a clear trend in the prevalence of disability.

We summarize conceptual frameworks used to characterize disability and review the HRS measures of functioning, work disability, and employer accommodations. HRS survey questions have experienced changes in wording, skip logic, or other design features over the life of the study, and we comment on the analytic challenges posed by those changes. Among our conclusions are (1) work disability and benefit eligibility are important concepts that should be considered for redesign to better reflect current concepts and policy issues; (2) methodological studies of changes in wording or skip logic should be undertaken; and (3) minor additions to survey content in areas such as temporal reference periods or changes in social-participation activities would improve measurement.},

abstract = {Statistical data is only as valuable as your ability to analyze, interpret, and present it in a meaningful way. Gnuplot is the most widely used program to plot and visualize data for Unix/Linux systems and it is also popular for Windows and the Mac. It's open-source (as in free!), actively maintained, stable, and mature. It can deal with arbitrarily large data sets and is capable of producing high-quality, publication-ready graphics. So far, the only comprehensive documentation available about gnuplot is the online reference documentation, which makes it both hard to get started and almost impossible to get a complete overview over all of its features. If you've never tried gnuplot—or have found it tough to get your arms around—read on. Gnuplot in Action is the first comprehensive introduction to gnuplot—from the basics to the power features and beyond. Besides providing a tutorial on gnuplot itself, it demonstrates how to apply and use gnuplot to extract intelligence from data. Particular attention is paid to tricky or poorly-explained areas. You will learn how to apply gnuplot to actual data analysis problems. This book looks at different types of graphs that can be generated with gnuplot and will discuss when and how to use them to extract actual information from data. One of gnuplot's main advantages is that it requires no programming skills nor knowledge of advanced mathematical or statistical concepts. Gnuplot in Action assumes you have no previous knowledge of either gnuplot or statistics and data analysis. The books starts out with basic gnuplot concepts, then describes in depth how to get a graph ready for final presentation and to make it look "just right" by including arrows, labels, and other decorations. Next the book looks at advanced concepts, such as multi-dimensional graphs and false-color plots—powerful features for special purposes. The author also describes advanced applications of gnuplot, such as how to script gnuplot so that it can run unattended as a batch job, and how to call gnuplot from within a CGI script to generate graphics for dynamic websites on demand. Gnuplot in Action makes gnuplot easy for anyone who needs to do data analysis, but doesn't have an education in analytical tools and methods. It's perfect for DBAs, programmers, and performance engineers; business analysts and MBAs; and Six-Sigma Black Belts and process engineers.},

Job-hopping is important in computer clusters because it facilitates the reallocation of talent and resources toward firms with superior innovations. Using new data on labor mobility, we find higher rates of job-hopping for college-educated men in Silicon Valley's computer industry than in computer clusters located out of the state. Mobility rates in other California computer clusters are similar to Silicon Valley's, suggesting some role for features of California law that make noncompete agreements unenforceable. Consistent with our model of innovation, mobility rates outside computer industries are no higher in California than elsewhere.},

Using a sample of non-Cuban high school dropouts we find no significant difference in the wages of workers in Miami relative to its control after 1980. We also show that by focusing on small subsamples and matching the control group on a short pre-1979 series, as done in Borjas (2017), one can find large wage differences between Miami and the control because of large measurement error.},

abstract = {The sales tax shows wide variation across states. Rates differ, some states allow local options, and the base can vary dramatically. Consumer items like food are often afforded preferential treatment, and business purchases like manufacturing machinery are exempt in some states. There is no research that explores these and other sales tax base choices. This article provides an empirical examination of sales tax base choice on the part of states using a political economy framework and tools of spatial econometrics. The analysis accommodates tax competition among states, using a variety of alternative definitions of "competitors." The authors find little evidence that consumer exemptions are linked to needy segments of the population, while equipment exemptions are more common in states with large industrial sectors. The results also show that the nature of the interstate tax competition process differs for different elements of the base and that nongeographic competition can be especially important.

abstract = {Securing stable housing to prevent the spread of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic remains a concern among policymakers in the US. In this article, we provide a descriptive analysis of the association between COVID-19-related eviction moratoriums and eviction filings in New Orleans, Louisiana. Beginning in March 2020, four separate moratoriums were implemented at the local, state, and federal levels that sought to restrict eviction filings in New Orleans. We collected data on evictions filed from January 2017 through November 2020 in the First City Court of Orleans Parish, the entity responsible for adjudicating the majority of eviction filings in New Orleans. We then examined the association between the various eviction moratoriums, the number of evictions filed, the estimated number of evictions temporarily averted, and the average suit dollar amount for filed evictions. Our results indicate that local and state moratoriums were effective at temporarily halting eviction filings. Federal moratoriums offering fewer protections reduced eviction filings by approximately 50{\%}. We estimate that COVID-19-related eviction moratoriums temporarily averted 2,492 eviction filings in New Orleans between March and November 2020. The average suit amount for eviction filings that resumed following the expiration of local and state moratoriums doubled from pre-COVID-19 filing amounts.},

abstract = {Crime is a major activity in the US, with implications for poverty and the allocation of public and private resources. The economics of crime focuses on the effect of incentives on criminal behavior, the way decisions interact in a market setting; and the use of a benefit-cost framework to assess alternative strategies to reduce crime. This essay shows that most empirical evidence supports the role of incentives in the criminal decision: legitimate labor market experiences, sanctions including incarceration, and the risk of apprehension all influence decisions to engage in crime. By putting crime into a market setting, economic analysis highlights the difficulty of reducing crime through incapacitation: when the elasticity of supply to crime is high, one criminal replaces another in the market; and thus the importance of deterring crime by altering behavior. Most analyses show that "crime pays" in the sense of offering higher wages than legitimate work, presumably in part to offset the risk of apprehension. But some important facts about crime - long term trend increases and decreases; the geographic concentration of crime; the preponderance of men and the young in crime - seem to go beyond basic economic analysis. ?? 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Delaying mandatory retirement age is one of the measures that governments across Europe propose to combat future labour force shortages. Although a growing number of older workers are willing to extend their working career, the evidence suggests that employers favour early retirement rather than retention of older workers. The current study examines how managers evaluate the desirability of postponing retirement of older workers and what is the impact of age norms and ageist stereotypes on managers' decisions. To investigate this question, a factorial study among 238 managers in Dutch organizations was conducted. Profiles of hypothetical older workers were presented to the employers, who evaluated the desirability of keeping them in the organization for a few more years. Information on age norms and age stereotypes, collected a month before the vignette study was administered, was consecutively combined in the analysis. The results indicate that keeping older workers until the mandatory retirement age is not essential for managers. Our study also shows that age norms positively affect managers' propensity to retain older workers.},

abstract = {Stigma and social inequality deprive disadvantaged social groups of a sense of social well-being. Stress researchers have focused on prejudice-related events and conditions but have not described more intangible stressors experienced by sexual minorities. We use narrative methods to examine how sexual minorities experience stigma and social inequality as we focus on the more intangible stressors that are both pervasive and difficult to measure. Three themes emerged in the narratives of our ethnically diverse sample of 57 adult sexual minority women and men: (a) stigma deprived them of access to critical possibilities and opportunities; (b) stigma deprives them of safety and acceptance; and (c) despite this, the experience of stigma is also related to the adoption of a positive and collective orientation towards their stigmatized identities. Recognizing these stressors and related resilience can direct policy makers toward interventions that go even beyond eliminating prejudice by including goals to strengthen minority communities. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

To understand how the crisis is affecting evictions, we measured eviction filing activity across 44 cities and counties. As of July 7, 2020, eviction filings have almost returned to their prepandemic levels in places where local bans have expired or where they were never enacted. We find that eviction filings tend to surge after temporary policies expire much more in places that enacted both filing bans and hearing bans than those that enacted just hearing bans while allowing filings to continue. As federal stimulus supplements for the unemployed expire, evictions are likely to increase for households that have lost work because of the crisis unless there is material improvement in the economy (Mervosh 2020).},

This article argues that restricting attention to response rates can lead to faulty inferences about substantive discrimination depending on how response dummies are correlated with other response characteristics. We illustrate the relevance of this problem by means of a conjoint experiment among all German welfare offices, in which we randomly varied five traits and designed requests to allow for a substantive coding of response quality. We find that response rates are statistically indistinguishable across treatment conditions. However, putative non-Germans receive responses of significantly lower quality, potentially deterring them from applying for benefits. We also find observational evidence suggesting that discrimination is more pronounced in welfare offices run by local governments than in those embedded in the national bureaucracy. We discuss implications for the study of equality in the public sphere.},

While much extant research assumes that com- bining marginalized social categories results in a ‘‘double disadvantage,'' I argue that in the case of race and sexual orientation the opposite may be true. This article posits that stereotypes about gay men as effeminate and weak will counteract common negative stereotypes held by whites that black men are threatening and criminal. Thus, I argue that being gay will have negative consequences for white men in the job application process, but that being gay will actually have positive consequences for black men in this realm. This hypothesis is tested using data from a survey experiment in which respondents were asked to evaluate resumes for a job opening where the race and sexual orientation of the applicants were experimentally manipulated. The findings contribute to important theoretical debates about stereotypes, dis- crimination, and intersecting social identities.},

A sample of 298 participants aged 20–92 rated 65-year-old men and women on evaluative statements in eight different life domains. Furthermore, perceptions of gender- and domain-specific age-related changes were assessed by comparing the older targets to 45-year-old men and women, respectively. The results speak in favor of the domain specificity of evaluative asymmetries in age stereotypes for men and women, and imply that an understanding of gendered perceptions of aging requires taking into account the complexities of domain-specific views on aging.},

I also study the special case of evaluating a job training program, borrowing a credible selection rule from Heckman, LaLonde, and Smith (1999) and relying on the parameters of the wage process estimated by MaCurdy (1982). I derive closed forms for the bias terms of the two estimators when the error terms are normally distributed. I show that DID matching is unbiased when applied symmetrically around the period of enrollment, as implemented by Heckman, Ichimura, Smith, and Todd (1998). DID-matching is more robust than matching to mis- specification both of the amount of information individuals have when deciding to enter the program and of the control period. I finally point to previously unnoticed experimen- tal results that confirm the claim that DID-matching is less biased than matching. Keywords:},

Using household data from the PSID, we generate a panel of households whose homeownership we observe over a 15 year period and whose wealth accumulation we observe at three points in time: 1994, 1999 and 2001. We investigate the extent to which homeownership has an independent impact on the wealth accumulation of LMI households, controlling for a host of other variables and unobserved heterogeneity. Accounting for the skewed nature of the wealth distribution, we find that each additional year of homeownership increases total net wealth by {\$}13.7 K on average for the full sample. Interacting income status with years of homeownership indicates that the impact of homeownership varies by income status, with each additional year of homeownership being associated with {\$}15 K more in wealth holdings for high-income households and roughly {\$}6 to 10 K more in wealth holdings for LMI households. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

To structurally estimate agglomeration and dispersion forces, we use data on thousands of city blocks in Berlin for 1936, 1986, and 2006 and exogenous variation from the city's division and reunification. We estimate substantial and highly localized production and residential externalities. We show that the model with the estimated agglomeration parameters can account both qualitatively and quantitatively for the observed changes in city structure. We show how our quantitative framework can be used to undertake counterfactuals for changes in the organization of economic activity within cities in response, for example, to changes in the transport network.},

abstract = {Objective: Although anecdotal evidence indicates the effectiveness of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) social-distancing policies, their effectiveness in relation to what is driven by public awareness and voluntary actions needs to be determined. We evaluated the effectiveness of the 6 most common social-distancing policies in the United States (statewide stay-at-home orders, limited stay-at-home orders, nonessential business closures, bans on large gatherings, school closure mandates, and limits on restaurants and bars) during the early stage of the pandemic. Methods: We applied difference-in-differences and event-study methodologies to evaluate the effect of the 6 social-distancing policies on Google-released aggregated, anonymized daily location data on movement trends over time by state for all 50 states and the District of Columbia in 6 location categories: retail and recreation, grocery stores and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residences. We compared the outcome of interest in states that adopted COVID-19–related policies with states that did not adopt such policies, before and after these policies took effect during February 15–April 25, 2020. Results: Statewide stay-at-home orders had the strongest effect on reducing out-of-home mobility and increased the time people spent at home by an estimated 2.5 percentage points (15.2{\%}) from before to after policies took effect. Limits on restaurants and bars ranked second and resulted in an increase in presence at home by an estimated 1.4 percentage points (8.5{\%}). The other 4 policies did not significantly reduce mobility. Conclusion: Statewide stay-at-home orders and limits on bars and restaurants were most closely linked to reduced mobility in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the potential benefits of other such policies may have already been reaped from voluntary social distancing. Further research is needed to understand how the effect of social-distancing policies changes as voluntary social distancing wanes during later stages of a pandemic.},

In later rounds, however, taste-based models predict continued excess votes, whereas statistical discrimination predicts fewer votes against the target group. Although players are voting strategically, evidence of discrimination is limited. There is little in the data to suggest discrimination against women and blacks.

In 2010, the Georgia Department of Revenue saw over {\$}45 million in tax off-set liability claimed by Georgia taxpayers as a direct result of the film tax credit. In the same year, the Special Council on Tax Reform and Fairness for Georgians found that although the film tax credit led to a substantial increase in the number of films in the state of Georgia, it is unclear whether the revenue generated from the credit exceeds the cost to the state. Of the 45 states offering film tax incentives, only 14 states did an in-depth analysis of the economic competiveness of the credit. Although some states found that the film tax credit did little to encourage job and revenue growth within the state, other states found the film tax credit to be considered a valuable economic development tool. Other state studies identified several evaluation models that could be used to evaluate the Georgia film tax incentive. Finally, other states identified several ways to enhance the economic competiveness of a film tax credit to include talent retention, loan programs, expansion of post-production, and purpose targeted tax incentives.},

abstract = {Disparities in the care and outcomes of US racial/ethnic minorities are well documented. Research suggests that provider bias plays a role in these disparities. The implicit association test enables measurement of implicit bias via tests of automatic associations between concepts. Hundreds of studies have examined implicit bias in various settings, but relatively few have been conducted in healthcare. The aim of this systematic review is to synthesize the current knowledge on the role of implicit bias in healthcare disparities. A comprehensive literature search of several databases between May 2015 and September 2016 identified 37 qualifying studies. Of these, 31 found evidence of pro-White or light-skin/anti-Black, Hispanic, American Indian or dark-skin bias among a variety of HCPs across multiple levels of training and disciplines. Fourteen studies examined the association between implicit bias and healthcare outcomes using clinical vignettes or simulated patients. Eight found no statistically significant association between implicit bias and patient care while six studies found that higher implicit bias was associated with disparities in treatment recommendations, expectations of therapeutic bonds, pain management, and empathy. All seven studies that examined the impact of implicit provider bias on real-world patient-provider interaction found that providers with stronger implicit bias demonstrated poorer patient-provider communication. Two studies examined the effect of implicit bias on real-world clinical outcomes. One found an association and the other did not. Two studies tested interventions aimed at reducing bias, but only one found a post-intervention reduction in implicit bias. This review reveals a need for more research exploring implicit bias in real-world patient care, potential modifiers and confounders of the effect of implicit bias on care, and strategies aimed at reducing implicit bias and improving patient-provider communication. Future studies have the opportunity to build on this current body of research, and in doing so will enable us to achieve equity in healthcare and outcomes.},

The racial gap in employment opportunities is larger when comparisons are made between job seekers with credentials that proxy for expected productivity and/or match quality. Moreover, the racial discrimination detected is driven by greater discrimination in jobs that require customer interaction. Various tests for the type of discrimination tend to support taste-based discrimination, but we are unable to rule out risk aversion on the part of employers as a possible explanation.},

abstract = {Medicaid and uninsured patients are disadvantaged in access to care and are disproportionately Black and Hispanic. Using a national audit of primary care physicians, we examine the relationship between state Medicaid fees for primary care services and access for Medicaid, Medicare, uninsured, and privately insured patients who differ by race/ethnicity and sex. We found that states with higher Medicaid fees had higher probabilities of appointment offers and shorter wait times for Medicaid patients, and lower probabilities of appointment offers and longer wait times for uninsured patients. Appointment offers and wait times for Medicare and privately insured patients were unaffected by Medicaid fees. At mean state Medicaid fees, our analysis predicts a 27-percentage-point disadvantage for Medicaid versus Medicare in appointment offers. This decreases to 6 percentage points when Medicaid and Medicare fees are equal, suggesting that permanent fee parity with Medicare could eliminate most of the disparity in appointment offers for Medicaid patients. The predicted decrease in the disparity is smaller for Black and Hispanic patients than for White patients. Our research highlights the importance of considering the effects of policy on nontarget patient groups, and the consequences of seemingly race-neutral policies on racial/ethnic and sex-based disparities.Copyright {\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {We investigated whether being attacked physically due to one's gender identity or expression was associated with suicide risk among trans men and women living in Virginia. The sample consisted of 350 transgender men and women who participated in the Virginia Transgender Health Initiative Survey (THIS). Multivariate multinomial logistic regression was used to explore the competing outcomes associated with suicidal risk. Thirty-seven percent of trans men and women experienced at least one physical attack since the age of 13. On average, individuals experienced 3.97 (SD = 2.86) physical attacks; among these about half were attributed to one's gender identity or expression (mean = 2.08, SD = 1.96). In the multivariate multinomial regression, compared to those with no risk, being physically attacked increased the odds of both attempting and contemplating suicide regardless of gender attribution. Nevertheless, the relative impact of physical victimization on suicidal behavior was higher among those who were targeted on the basis of their gender identity or expression. Finally, no significant association was found between multiple measures of institutional discrimination and suicide risk once discriminatory and non-discriminatory physical victimization was taken into account. Trans men and women experience high levels of physical abuse and face multiple forms of discrimination. They are also at an increased risk for suicidal tendencies. Interventions that help transindividuals cope with discrimination and physical victimization simultaneously may be more effective in saving lives.},

In macroeconomics, inter- active effects represent unobservable common shocks and their heterogeneous impacts on cross sections.We consider identification, consistency, and the limiting distribution of the interactive-effects estimator. Under both large N and large T, the estimator is shown to be √NT consistent, which is valid in the presence of correlations and heteroskedasticities of unknown form in both dimensions.We also derive the constrained estimator and its limiting distribution, imposing additivity coupled with interactive ef- fects. The problem of testing additive versus interactive effects is also studied. In ad- dition, we consider identification and estimation of models in the presence of a grand mean, time-invariant regressors, and common regressors.

abstract = {Objectives.To estimate the proportion of US adults who identify as transgender and to compare the demographics of the transgender and nontransgender populations. Methods.We conducted a secondary analysis of data from states and territories in the 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System that asked about transgender status. The proportion of adults identified as transgender was calculated from affirmative and negative responses (n = 151 456). We analyzed data with a design-adjusted Χ2 test. We also explored differences between male-to-female and nontransgender females and female-to-male and nontransgender males. Results.Transgender individuals made up 0.53{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval = 0.46, 0.61) of the population and were more likely to be non-White (40.0{\%} vs 27.3{\%}) and below the poverty line (26.0{\%} vs 15.5{\%}); as likely to be married (50.5{\%} vs 47.7{\%}), living in a rural area (28.7{\%} vs 22.6{\%}), and employed (54.3{\%} vs 57.7{\%}); and less likely to attend college (35.6{\%} vs 56.6{\%}) compared with nontransgender individuals. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that the transgender population is a racially diverse population present across US communities. Inequalities in the education and socioeconomic status have negative implications for the health of the transgender population.},

abstract = {Importance: Racial and ethnic disparities in access to health care may result from discrimination. Objectives: To identify differences in the rates at which patients belonging to racial/ethnic minority groups are offered primary care appointments and the number of days they wait for their primary care appointment and to understand the mechanisms by which discrimination occurs. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used 7 simulated black, Hispanic, and white patient callers to request appointments from 804 randomized primary care offices in 2 urban centers in Texas from November 2017 to February 2018. Data analysis was conducted between February and December 2018. Exposures: Research assistants called randomly assigned offices to schedule an appointment, supplying the same basic information. Race and ethnicity were signaled through callers' names and voices. Main Outcomes and Measures: Appointment offer rates, days to appointment, and questions asked during the call. Results: Of the 7 callers (age range, 18-29 years), 2 (28.6{\%}) self-identified as non-Hispanic black, 3 (42.9{\%}) self-identified as non-Hispanic white, and 2 (28.6{\%}) self-identified as Hispanic. Of the 804 calls they made, 299 (37.2{\%}) were from simulated white callers, 215 (26.7{\%}) were from simulated black callers, and 290 (36.1{\%}) were from simulated Hispanic callers. Overall, 582 callers (72.4{\%}) were offered appointments. In unadjusted models, black and Hispanic callers were more likely to be offered an appointment than white callers (black callers, 32.2 [95{\%} CI, 25.1-39.3] percentage points more likely; P {\textless} .001; Hispanic callers, 21.1 [95{\%} CI, 13.7-28.5] percentage points more likely; P {\textless} .001). However, after adjusting for whether insurance status was revealed, this statistical significance was lost. In adjusted models, black callers were 44.0 (95{\%} CI, 36.2-51.8) percentage points more likely to be asked about their insurance status than white callers (P {\textless} .001), and Hispanic callers were 25.3 (95{\%} CI, 17.1-33.5) percentage points more likely to be asked about their insurance status (P {\textless} .001) than white callers. Black and Hispanic callers received appointments further in the future than white callers (black callers: marginal effect estimate, 3.650; 95{\%} CI, 0.579 to 6.721; P = .08; Hispanic callers: marginal effect estimate, 2.644; 95{\%} CI, -0.496 to 5.784; P = .02). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, black and Hispanic patients were more likely to be offered an appointment, but they were asked more frequently about their insurance status than white callers. Black and Hispanic callers experienced longer wait times than white patients, indicating a barrier to timely access to primary care.},

abstract = {The synthetic control method (SCM) is a popular approach for estimating the impact of a treatment on a single unit in panel data settings. The "synthetic control" is a weighted average of control units that balances the treated unit's pre-treatment outcomes as closely as possible. The curse of dimensionality, however, means that SCM does not generally achieve exact balance, which can bias the SCM estimate. We propose an extension, Augmented SCM, which uses an outcome model to estimate the bias due to covariate imbalance and then de-biases the original SCM estimate, analogous to bias correction for inexact matching. We motivate this approach by showing that SCM is a (regularized) inverse propensity score weighting estimator, with pre-treatment outcomes as covariates and a ridge penalty on the propensity score coefficients. We give theoretical guarantees for specific cases and propose a new inference procedure. We demonstrate gains from Augmented SCM with extensive simulation studies and apply this framework to canonical SCM examples. We implement the proposed method in the new augsynth R package.},

abstract = {Background. Pain is strongly associated with significant personal and societal costs. A crucial element of any initiative on pain must focus on eliminating pain care disparities that are pervasive throughout the United States health care settings. Objectives. This report focuses on macro-level factors related to pain care disparities in the United States that may be amenable to policy interventions. Methods. We identify concrete opportunities for achieving equity in pain care, especially those occasioned by recent legislative changes in the United States health care system. An aggressive policy, advocacy, and research agenda is synthesized in five domains: 1) structural/system; 2) policy and advocacy; 3) workforce; 4) provider; and 5) research. Results. Inequities in pain care remain an important and neglected health policy concern. Many direct and indirect provisions within the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and other national initiatives that leverage on ACA offer opportunities to achieve equity in pain care. These include changes in insurance, in public, provider, and legislative education, in primary care and pain specialist training, improving workforce diversity, achieving uniformity in race/ethnicity data collection, emphasizing patient-centered outcomes research, and encouraging focus on pain care disparities within the comparative effectiveness research paradigm. Conclusions. Recent national legislative initiatives within ACA are expected to generate multilevel efforts that will impact the flow of funding to address the pervasive issue of disparities. It is an opportune time for the pain community to take a lead in implementing a concerted agenda on pain care disparities in order to leverage these national initiatives. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {This chapter summarizes recent research in economics that investigates differentials by race and gender in the labor market. We start with a statistical overview of the trends in labor market outcomes by race, gender and Hispanic origin, including some simple regressions on the determinants of wages and employment. This is followed in Section 3 by an extended review of current theories about discrimination in the labor market, including recent extensions of taste-based theories, theories of occupational exclusion, and theories of statistical discrimination. Section 4 discusses empirical research that provides direct evidence of discrimination in the labor market, beyond "unexplained gaps" in wage or employment regressions. The remainder of the chapter reviews the evidence on race and gender gaps, particularly wage gaps. Section 5 reviews research on the impact of pre-market human capital differences in education and family background that differ by race and gender. Section 6 reviews the impact of differences in both the levels and the returns to experience and seniority, with discussion of the role of training and labor market search and turnover on race and gender differentials. Section 7 reviews the role of job characteristics (particularly occupational characteristics) in the gender wage gap. Section 8 reviews the smaller literature on differences in fringe benefits by gender. Section 9 is an extensive discussion of the empirical work that accounts for changes in the trends in race and gender differentials over time. Of particular interest is the new research literature that investigates the impact of widening wage inequality on race and gender wage gaps. Section 10 reviews research that relates policy changes to race and gender differentials, including anti-discrimination policy. The chapter concludes with comments about a future research agenda. {\textcopyright} 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patient-physician race/ethnicity and language concordance may improve medication adherence and reduce disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) by fostering trust and improved patient-physician communication. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of patient race/ethnicity and language and patient-physician race/ethnicity and language concordance on medication adherence rates for a large cohort of diabetes patients in an integrated delivery system. DESIGN: We studied 131,277 adult diabetes patients in Kaiser Permanente Northern California in 2005. Probit models assessed the effect of patient and physician race/ethnicity and language on adherence to CVD medications, after controlling for patient and physician characteristics. RESULTS: Ten percent of African American, 11 {\%} of Hispanic, 63{\%} of Asian, and 47{\%} of white patients had same race/ethnicity physicians. 24{\%} of Spanish-speaking patients were linguistically concordant with their physicians. African American (46{\%}), Hispanic (49{\%}) and Asian (52{\%}) patients were significantly less likely than white patients (58{\%}) to be in good adherence to all of their CVD medications (p{\textless}0.001). Spanish-speaking patients were less likely than English speaking patients to be in good adherence (51{\%} versus 57{\%}, p{\textless}0.001). Race concordance for African American patients was associated with adherence to all their CVD medications (53{\%} vs. 50{\%}, p{\textless}0.05). Language concordance was associated with medication adherence for Spanish-speaking patients (51{\%} vs. 45{\%}, p{\textless}0.05). CONCLUSION: Increasing opportunities for patient-physician race/ethnicity and language concordance may improve medication adherence for African American and Spanish-speaking patients, though a similar effect was not observed for Asian patients or English-proficient Hispanic patients.},

A wide variety of empirical tests of models based on those theories have been developed, as well as extensive and reliable data bases to test theories. Thus, one can experiment with and simulate economic behavior. For these reasons, the conventional lecture-discussion format may be the least effective way to teach economics. Rather, the most effective teaching method may be as a laboratory science. Authors report on recent efforts to convert economics to a true, experimental, laboratory social science. The project at Denison University is a demonstration since its design does not have a randomly assigned control group. All economics majors in the program at Denison took part in the project. Using a classical random experimental design, Washington State University is testing the conversion of introductory micro- and macroeconomics courses from a standard lecture and discussion format to a lecture and laboratory format that integrates the principles of active learning with personal computers, data on actual economic behavior, and in-class economic experiments.},

abstract = {Purpose – In light of the increasingly aging workforce, it is interesting from both a theoretical and practical perspective to investigate empirically the commonly held stereotype that older workers are more resistant to change (RTC). Thus, the main purpose of this paper is to investigate the age/RTC relationship, considering tenure and occupational status (blue/white collar employees) as additional boundary conditions. Furthermore, the paper investigates the relationship between RTC and individual performance, thereby introducing RTC as a mediator in the age/job performance relationship. Design/methodology/approach – Study hypotheses are tested among a sample of 2,981 employees from diverse companies. Structural equation modeling with bootstrapping procedures is applied to investigate the moderated-indirect model. Findings – Contrary to common stereotypes, employee age is negatively related to RTC. Tenure and occupational status are further identified as boundary conditions for this relationship. Moreover, RTC also shows an association with individual job performance, which allows for the establishment of an indirect-mediation mechanism from age to job performance via the intermediation of RTC. These results can be explained using current life span concepts, particularly the selective optimization with compensation (SOC) model. Research limitations/implications – Hypotheses were tested in a cross-sectional data set, which does not allow for conclusions of causality. Originality/value – This study contributes to the age stereotyping literature that has thus far neglected the age/RTC relationship. Furthermore, the age/job performance literature is extended by introducing RTC as an important mediating factor. In sum, this study should help provide a more positive and more differentiated picture of older employees in the workplace. Keywords},

We conducted an adapted audit experiment to test whether making officials aware of bias could reduce levels of racial bias. While the limitations of our design make it difficult to assess where information alone can reduce bias, our study makes two important contributions. First, we replicate prior studies by showing that white, local elected officials are less responsive to black constituents. That local officials exhibit biased behavior is particularly worrisome, as local government is often the level that most directly affects citizens' daily lives. Second, we provide several suggestions for future audit studies that draw from the strengths and weaknesses of our own design.

Recent empirical findings illustrate cases when the linkage between nonresponse rates and nonresponse biases is absent. Despite this, professional standards continue to urge high response rates. Statistical expressions of nonre-sponse bias can be translated into causal models to guide hypotheses about when nonresponse causes bias. Alternative designs to measure nonresponse bias exist, providing different but incomplete information about the nature of the bias. A synthesis of research studies estimating nonresponse bias shows the bias often present. A logical question at this moment in history is what advantage probability sample surveys have if they suffer from high nonresponse rates. Since postsurvey adjustment for nonresponse requires auxiliary variables, the answer depends on the nature of the design and the quality of the auxiliary variables.},

Design: The 2-year cumulative incidence of functional limitation was estimated from survival analysis methods by using elders without baseline functional limitations. Setting: Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA). Initial interviews: 1984; reinterviews: 1986, 1988, and 1990. Participants: A total of 4205 elderly subjects from the LSOA. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Dependent variables: self-reported moderate (1-2 ADLs) and severe (≥3 ADLs) functional limitation. Independent variables: sociodemographics, self-reported chronic conditions, and prior levels of functional limitation. Results: Gender and race predicted moderate functional limitation onset, after controlling for age and education. Arthritis, diabetes, prior cerebrovascular disease (CVD), incontinence, and impaired vision were significant predictors of moderate functional limitation onset after controlling for demographics. Differences in the prevalence of chronic conditions appear to explain why moderate functional limitation incidence rates are higher in older women and blacks. Gender, but not race, predicted onset of severe functional limitation, after controlling for age and education. Prior moderate functional limitation, CVD, and vision impairment predicted onset of severe functional limitation after controlling for demographics. Conclusion: Prevention of functional decline should target chronic conditions and moderate functional limitation in older adults. {\textcopyright} 2002 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},

abstract = {This paper traces the genealogy of sexual orientation discourse in US legal scholarship and explores potential drawbacks of the articulation of a sexual orientation argument in the field of relationship recognition. After a long period of refraining from campaigning for legal recognition of multi-partner relationships, polyamory activists have recently shown a stronger interest in litigation. This paper identifies reasons for this shift in recent successes of the campaign for same-sex marriage rights and critically discusses proposals to frame polyamory as a sexual orientation to achieve multi-partner marriage rights through litigation. I argue that advocating a sexual orientation model of polyamory is likely to reduce the complexity and transformative potential of poly intimacies, limit the scope and reach of potential litigation, obstruct the capacity of poly activism to form alliances and increase the likelihood of poly activism to settle for legal solutions (i.e. marriage) that are exclusive and reproductive of a culture of privilege.

abstract = {A complete and up-to-date survey of microeconometric methods available in Stata, Microeconometrics Using Stata, Revised Editionis an outstanding introduction to microeconometrics and how to execute microeconometric research using Stata. It covers topics left out of most microeconometrics textbooks and omitted from basic introductions to Stata. This revised edition has been updated to reflect the new features available in Stata 11 that are useful to microeconomists. Instead of using mfx and the user-written margeff commands, the authors employ the new margins command, emphasizing both marginal effects at the means and average marginal effects. They also replace the xi command with factor variables, which allow you to specify indicator variables and interaction effects. Along with several new examples, this edition presents the new gmm command for generalized method of moments and nonlinear instrumental-variables estimation. In addition, the chapter on maximum likelihood estimation incorporates enhancements made to ml in Stata 11. Throughout the book, the authors use simulation methods to illustrate features of the estimators and tests described and provide an in-depth Stata example for each topic discussed. They also show how to use Stata'"s programming features to implement methods for which Stata does not have a specific command. The unique combination of topics, intuitive introductions to methods, and detailed illustrations of Stata examples make this book an invaluable, hands-on addition to the library of anyone who uses microeconometric methods.},

abstract = {The bootstrap is a method for estimating the distribution of an estimator or test statistic by resampling one's data or a model estimated from the data. Under conditions that hold in a wide variety of econometric applications, the bootstrap provides approximations to distributions of statistics, coverage probabilities of confidence intervals, and rejection probabilities of hypothesis tests that are more accurate than the approximations of first-order asymptotic distribution theory. The reductions in the differences between true and nominal coverage or rejection probabilities can be very large. The bootstrap is a practical technique that is ready for use in applications. This chapter explains and illustrates the usefulness and limitations of the bootstrap in contexts of interest in econometrics. The chapter outlines the theory of the bootstrap, provides numerical illustrations of its performance, and gives simple instructions on how to implement the bootstrap in applications. The presentation is informal and expository. Its aim is to provide an intuitive understanding of how the bootstrap works and a feeling for its practical value in econometrics.},

@article{Hausman2012,
abstract = {Approximately 20 years ago, Peter Diamond and I wrote an article for this journal analyzing contingent valuation methods. At that time Peter's view was that contingent valuation was hopeless, while I was dubious but somewhat more optimistic. But 20 years later, after millions of dollars of largely government-funded research, I have concluded that Peter's earlier position was correct and that contingent valuation is hopeless. In this paper, I selectively review the contingent valuation literature, focusing on empirical results. I find that three long-standing problems continue to exist: 1) hypothetical response bias that leads contingent valuation to overstatements of value; 2) large differences between willingness to pay and willingness to accept; and 3) the embedding problem which encompasses scope problems. The problems of embedding and scope are likely to be the most intractable. Indeed, I believe that respondents to contingent valuation surveys are often not responding out of stable or well-defined preferences, but are essentially inventing their answers on the fly, in a way which makes the resulting data useless for serious analysis. Finally, I offer a case study of a prominent contingent valuation study done by recognized experts in this approach, a study that should be only minimally affected by these concerns but in which the answers of respondents to the survey are implausible and inconsistent.},

abstract = {Historically, the pathologisation of LGBTQ orientations shaped research and professional practice, while the impact of stigma was not considered. Within a minority stress conceptualisation however, stigma-related prejudice and discrimination experienced by LGBTQ people constitute chronically stressful events that can lead to negative health outcomes. Minority stress has been linked to psychological distress among gay men and lesbians and may contribute to elevated rates of distress frequently observed among LGBTQ youth. This study explored the impact of minority stress on psychological distress among LGBTQ youth in Ireland. Measures assessing three components of minority stress (sexual identity distress, stigma consciousness, and heterosexist experiences) were administered online to LGBTQ youth aged 16-24 years (N=301). Each minority stressor had a significant independent association with distress. Stepwise regression analyses identified the linear combination of minority stressors as significantly predictive of distress [F(3,201)=30.80, P={\textless} .001]. Results suggest that the oppressive social environment created through sexual/transgender identity-related stigma negatively impacts on the well-being of LGBTQ youth. Findings have implications for health professionals and policy makers interested in the concerns of LGBTQ youth experiencing difficulties related to minority status and will facilitate the development and tailoring of interventions aimed at reaching those most at risk.},

abstract = {We live in a fast paced digital age. The growing popularity of the Web influences all aspects of our life, has changed the way we live, work, study and even think. As a result the role of library and information professionals is subject to radical changes. Catalogue is the core of every library, a basic tool of retrieval in any document collection. A library without a catalogue cannot fulfill its functions efficiently. The practice of collecting written knowledge in some sort of repository in a certain order is old as civilization itself. It does not lose its importance nowadays when we strive to retrieve some relevant information in the chaos of the net. I'd like to draw your attention to the profession of a cataloguer, which I love, and which is more often, taking into consideration my colleagues, attract people demonstrating such qualities as dedication, creativity, persistency, and enthusiasm. Cataloguers played a key role in organization of recorded knowledge of the human civilization thus making records searchable and retrievable. I am telling these well known facts in view of a modern trend to acquire a wrong attitude to a role of cataloguing profession . One can come across with reports of the so-called " restructuring " and closure of cataloguing departments. There is a tendency to reduce and eliminate the professionals who catalogue which results in databases full of errors, low quality records, duplicating of records and inconsistencies, and eventually to the " de-professionalisation " of cataloguing. It is important that collections are being developed and maintained by professionals who understand the structure of the information. Another trend arises, the tendency is that the present generation of cataloguers is retiring or is close to join those " young at heart " , which means the loss of professional memory. We need specialists with broad understanding of the principles of cataloguing and bibliographic control. The library users depend of the dedicated and quality work of cataloguers which can save time and frustration while searching for the desired information. The growth of information technology and computerization add to the need for that quality. In this situation we turn to the library schools, and to our greatest disappointment, find out that cataloguing is not even a core subject in many of them. The concern over the cataloguing training is international. I have come across over a very interesting online survey conducted by Cynthia Boeke (the assistant curator for The American Society for Cell Biology's Image {\&} Video Library). One of the questions in the survey was: " What do you think is the most important issues facing catalog profession right now, and why it is so important? " Many participants showed their concern that not enough students are attracted to the subject of cataloguing, as well as the decreasing amount and quality of cataloguing training in library schools nowadays. Below are some extracts from this survey: " The lack of professional librarians who want to pursuer a career in cataloging is the most important issue right now. Why? Without catalogers, access to the bibliographic 2 resources owned by libraries won't happen. " Cynthia Whitecre, Manager, Metadata Quality Dept.,OCLC. " I consider the education and training of future catalogers to be critical. During the past ten years, many library schools ceased making 'organization of information' a required course. As result, many library school students haven't had the opportunity to discover cataloging as possible profession for them. Cataloging courses that do exist are often inadequate, inconsistent, or too difficult " Billie Hackney, Head of Monograph Cataloging, Getty Research Institute. " Cataloging is less and less represented in courses (at least in France), whilst it should be more and more developed. A student recently said to me: 'The catalog stands at the core of all library services, why does it not stand at the core of a library curator's formal training?' " Patrick Le Boeuf, curator of the National Library of France. Recent literature recognizes the challenges faced by library schools today and prompt educators to implement effective teaching strategies and methodologies. There are examples of possible creative solutions. Having said this, I'd like to mention a highly interesting and innovative approach to teaching descriptive cataloguing at the University of Queensland by utilizing various innovative methods and media for teaching activities, where students were encouraged to think critically about broader issues. The results of this pilot project are " beyond expectations " as students clearly indicated that learning about descriptive cataloguing, a good knowledge of AACR and MARC is highly relevant. (Gillian Hallam " Beyond our expectations: a review of an Independent learning module at the Queensland University of Technology ") The project at the University of Queensland is an evidence that there are ways to attract the students to this challenging and, to my mind, satisfying profession. The profession that has a long and honorable history behind it. Nowadays the ever-expanding growth of information and information technology, increasing volumes and multiple formats of information, changing user expectations and behaviors brought about even higher levels of challenges for cataloguers. To pursue professional ethics in creating timely and high quality records cataloguers are to develop a new mindset to deal with the increased complexity in cataloguing. New technologies require new skills. The modern cataloguer has to be multi-skilled, computer literate, able to operate different in-house library systems, able to use the online packages, such as MARC21 standard online, WEB Dewey, LCSH Authorities, LA Search interface, Sanborn Cutter, national and international union online catalogues. The cultural changes in the society brought about additional requirement. The modern cataloguer has to be multilingual, able to catalogue materials in different languages, including those in non-Roman script, able to insert vernacular statements into the bibliographic record. Cataloguers have to keep pace with the changing environment, managing materials in new formats, manipulate different metadata schemes, catalogue for diverse user environments and audiences.},

Both issues were investigated by questionnaire survey, producing responses from over 1000 employees of a major UK financial services enterprise. The extent and manifestations of ageism were found to vary across age categories and by sex, and evidence of gendered ageism emerged. Reported examples of ageism were highest among younger and older age categories, but all age groups were affected to some degree. Across all ages, women were more likely than men to experience ageist attitudes concerning appearance or sexuality. To be effective, legislation will need to cater for the complex nature and patterns of age discrimination revealed, though the comparator problem and other complexities are such that important aspects of age prejudice, including gender dimensions, risk being overlooked.},

abstract = {Relying on a commonly used fixed-offer bargaining script we examine gender differences in bargaining outcomes in a highly competitive and frequently used market: the taxi market in Lima, Peru. Our bargaining script secures that only the seller can change prices and terminate negotiations, thus we are able to examine differences in the seller's entire path of negotiation and in the reservation price at which they are willing to trade. We find that male and female passengers who use the same bargaining script are not treated equally. Men face higher initial prices, final prices, and rejection rates. These differences are consistent with male drivers being more reluctant to give-in to demanding negotiations by male passengers, and with male passengers being perceived as having high valuations. To identify whether taste-based or statistical discrimination drives the inferior treatment of men we conduct an experiment where passengers send a signal on valuation before negotiating. The signal eliminates gender differences and the response is shown only to be consistent with statistical discrimination. Thus in the limiting case of a highly competitive market with experienced traders, we do not find evidence of taste-based discrimination, the differential observed is however consistent with statistical discrimination. ?? 2013.},

@article{Drwecki2015,
abstract = {In the past decades, various protein subcellular-location (SCL) predictors have been developed. Most of these predictors, like TMHMM 2.0, SignalP 3.0, PrediSi and Phobius, aim at the identification of one or a few SCLs, whereas others such as CELLO and Psortb.v.2.0 aim at a broader classification. Although these tools and pipelines can achieve a high precision in the accurate prediction of signal peptides and transmembrane helices, they have a much lower accuracy when other sequence characteristics are concerned. For instance, it proved notoriously difficult to identify the fate of proteins carrying a putative type I signal peptidase (SPIase) cleavage site, as many of those proteins are retained in the cell membrane as N-terminally anchored membrane proteins. Moreover, most of the SCL classifiers are based on the classification of the Swiss-Prot database and consequently inherited the inconsistency of that SCL classification. As accurate and detailed SCL prediction on a genome scale is highly desired by experimental researchers, we decided to construct a new SCL prediction pipeline: LocateP. LocateP combines many of the existing high-precision SCL identifiers with our own newly developed identifiers for specific SCLs. The LocateP pipeline was designed such that it mimics protein targeting and secretion processes. It distinguishes 7 different SCLs within Gram-positive bacteria: intracellular, multi-transmembrane, N-terminally membrane anchored, C-terminally membrane anchored, lipid-anchored, LPxTG-type cell-wall anchored, and secreted/released proteins. Moreover, it distinguishes pathways for Sec- or Tat-dependent secretion and alternative secretion of bacteriocin-like proteins. The pipeline was tested on data sets extracted from literature, including experimental proteomics studies. The tests showed that LocateP performs as well as, or even slightly better than other SCL predictors for some locations and outperforms current tools especially where the N-terminally anchored and the SPIase-cleaved secreted proteins are concerned. Overall, the accuracy of LocateP was always higher than 90{\%}. LocateP was then used to predict the SCLs of all proteins encoded by completed Gram-positive bacterial genomes. The results are stored in the database LocateP-DB http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/locatep-db [1].

abstract = {Using refinements of hypotheses by L. M. Finkelstein, M. J. Burke, and N. S. Raju (1995), the authors examined the effects of rater age, age salience, and job-relevant information on 324 managers' ratings of an older or a younger hypothetical applicant's interpersonal skills, economic worth, and likelihood of being interviewed. They hypothesized that age identity would interact with age salience to produce ingroup biases that would lead raters to favor workers from their own age groups. There was a main effect of target age on all dependent variables, with the strongest effects on the ratings of economic worth: The participants rated the older target as less economically beneficial than the younger target. When age was highly salient and when the raters identified psychologically with their age groups, older raters actually disfavored older workers in ratings of economic worth. The authors also discuss directions of future research into the roles of the target's economic worth and the rater's age identity in age stereotyping and age discrimination in employment decisions.},

The author uses a much larger time span than in any previous research—607 economics classes over 17 semesters. This permits a proper treatment of unobserved heterogeneity. Results indicate that instructors can buy higher SET scores by awarding higher grades. In principles classes, the level of experience of the instructor and the class size are found to be significant determinants of SET scores. In upper-division classes, the type of student and the response rate matter. In both types of classes, factors specific to courses, instructors, and time periods are important; adjustments of scores to remove these influences may be warranted.},

Many knowledgeable observers believe that the US is in the midst of a speculative bubble in residential real estate prices that rivals the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and that will have a similarly unhappy conclusion. To gauge whether the projected cash flow from a home justifies the current price, with no assumptions about future prices, the researchers look at an infinite horizon. In their data the median after-tax IRRs with an infinite horizon ranged from 4.6{\%} in San Mateo to 21.2{\%} in Indianapolis. With a ten-year horizon, and assuming that prices increase by 3{\%} a year, the after-tax IRRs range from 3.5{\%} in San Mateo to 23.6{\%} in Indianapolis. In a bubble, market prices rise far above fundamental values calculated with reasonable assumptions about future cash flow. By this definition there was no bubble in the prices of single-family homes in 2005.},

Suggested explanations include discrimination and differences in preferences and human capital. In this paper we present experimental evidence in support of an additional factor: women may be less effective than men in competitive environments, even if they are able to perform similarly in non- competitive environments. In a laboratory experiment we observe, as we increase the competitiveness of the environment, a significant increase in performance for men, but not for women. This results in a significant gender gap in performance in tournaments, while there is no gap when participants are paid according to piece rate. This effect is stronger when women have to compete against men than in single-sex competitive environments: this suggests that women may be able to perform in competitive environments per se.},

While some consider polyamory to be nothing more than a convenient label for their current relationship constellations or a handy tool for communicating their willingness to enter more than one relationship at a time, others claim it as one of their core identities. Essentialist identity narratives have sustained recent arguments that polyamory is best understood as a sexual orientation and is as such comparable with homosexuality, heterosexuality or bisexuality. Such a move would render polyamory intelligible within dominant political and legal frameworks of sexual diversity. The article surveys academic and activist discussions on sexual orientation and traces contradictory voices in current debates on polyamory. The author draws on poststructuralist ideas to show the shortcomings of sexual orientation discourses and highlights the losses which are likely to follow from pragmatic definitions of polyamory as sexual orientation. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.},

Of principal interest is the relatively new methodology of contingent valuation, which is a method for asking people directly about their preferences. The paper presents an application of the contingent valuation method to the conservation of an endangered species in the State of Victoria, Australia. The results emphasise the importance of careful survey design, implementation and analysis as well as the precise definition of the environmental good being valued. Consequently, the contingent valuationmethod does provide information relevant to decision making processes based on monetary economic considerations. Thus, in orthodox economic terms it makes sense to conserve species – but there are other moral and ethical grounds for conserving species as well.},

However, Muslims lose further ground when they are religious, while the reverse occurs for Christians. Consequently, religious Muslims must submit twice as many applications as religious Christians before being called back by the recruiters.

abstract = {This article examines which individual-level factors are related to people's likelihood of discriminating against ethnic minority job applicants. It moves beyond describing to what extent discrimination occurs by examining the role of individuals' interethnic contacts, education and religion in shaping their behavior towards ethnic minority job applicants. We derive expectations from theories from the interethnic attitudes literature. Data are collected via (1) a laboratory experiment in which student participants (n = 272) reviewed r{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}}s of fictitious applicants who varied regarding ethnicity, gender, education and work experience and (2) a survey amongst the same participants. During the experiment, participants assess applicants' suitability for a job and select applicants for an interview. Additionally, participants complete a questionnaire including questions on several personal and background features. Results show that individuals who have more positive interethnic contacts, higher educational levels and higher educated parents are less likely to discriminate against ethnic minority applicants. Individuals whose parents are church members are more likely to discriminate, as are males. We find interesting differences regarding the role of decision makers' features between different stages of the recruitment process. First assessments of applicants' suitability for a job are predominantly affected by applicants' features. Differences between decision makers here are relatively small. Eventual choices about which applicants to invite for a job interview, however, are affected by both applicants' and decision makers' features; here differences between decision makers are more pronounced. Theoretical implications of these findings are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Yet few large-scale assessments of these disparities among high school students exist. The Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) is conducted biennially among local, state, and nationally representative samples of U.S. high school students in grades 9-12. In 2017, 10 states (Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin) and nine large urban school districts (Boston, Broward County, Cleveland, Detroit, District of Columbia, Los Angeles, New York City, San Diego, San Francisco) piloted a measure of transgender identity. Using pooled data from these 19 sites, the prevalence of transgender identity was assessed, and relationships between transgender identity and violence victimization, substance use, suicide risk, and sexual risk behaviors were evaluated using logistic regression. Compared with cisgender males and cisgender females, transgender students were more likely to report violence victimization, substance use, and suicide risk, and, although more likely to report some sexual risk behaviors, were also more likely to be tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. These findings indicate a need for intervention efforts to improve health outcomes among transgender youths.},

Specifically, a recruitment corpus with ontology-driven rules is firstly built. Then, the Bi-LSTM-CRF model on an annotated subset of the corpus is trained and verified by the rest of the corpus. Further, a quantitative statistics of the discrimination (via entities annotations) and an aggregation of the prediction of annual demand for jobs were conducted. Finally, we evaluate our approach by collecting 5297 LIS job advertisements in the public sector from 2015 to 2019 and conclude the result that average F1 of the entity recognition on 520 posts with 5411 entities is up to 91.06{\%}. We statistically find that there exists serious institutional and employer discrimination ranging from political status (22.5{\%}), age (15.4{\%}), household registration (14.0{\%}), to educational background (13.8{\%}), etc. To our best knowledge, this is the first study investigating employment discrimination in the field of LIS in mainland China.},

abstract = {The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition technique is widely used to identify and quantify the separate contributions of group differences in measurable characteristics, such as education, experience, marital status, and geographical differences to racial and gender gaps in outcomes. The technique cannot be used directly, however, if the outcome is binary and the coefficients are from a logit or probit model. I describe a relatively simple method of performing a decomposition that uses estimates from a logit or probit model. Expanding on the original application of the technique in Fairlie [3], I provide a more thorough discussion of how to apply the technique, an analysis of the sensitivity of the decomposition estimates to different parameters, and the calculation of standard errors. I also compare the estimates to Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition estimates and discuss an example of when the Blinder-Oaxaca technique may be problematic.},

Using SIPP data, we explore how the ADA Amendments Act (ADAAA), which expanded disability discrimination protections, affected the relative hiring rate of individuals with disabilities. We employ new categorizations of disability type: salient physical conditions, non-salient physical conditions, mental retardation and developmental disability, and other mental conditions. We find that the ADAAA had no effect other than increasing hiring for those with non-salient physical conditions. These results suggest that condition saliency may mediate the effects of discrimination protections on hiring.},

It is found that inference is not possible unless the researcher has prior information specifying the composition of reference groups. If this information is available, the prospects for inference depend critically on the population relationship between the variables defining reference groups and those directly affecting outcomes. Inference is difficult to impossible if these variables are functionally dependent or are statistically independent. The prospects are better if the variables defining reference groups and those directly affecting outcomes are moderately related in the population.},

abstract = {In this essay, we review the basic economics of housing supply and the functioning of US housing markets to better understand the distribution of home prices, household wealth and the spatial distribution of people across markets. We employ a cost-based approach to gauge whether a housing market is delivering appropriately priced units. Specifically, we investigate whether market prices (roughly) equal the costs of producing the housing unit. If so, the market is well-functioning in the sense that it efficiently delivers housing units at their production cost. Of course, poorer households still may have very high housing cost burdens that society may wish to address via transfers. But if housing prices are above this cost in a given area, then the housing market is not functioning well— and housing is too expensive for all households in the market, not just for poorer ones. The gap between price and production cost can be understood as a regulatory tax, which might be efficiently incorporating the negative externalities of new production, but typical estimates find that the implicit tax is far higher than most reasonable estimates of those externalities. download in pdf format},

Provider-related factors are hypothesized to contribute to unequal treatment, but these factors have not been examined extensively. This mixed methods investigation examined the influence of patients' demographic characteristics on providers' treatment decisions and providers' awareness of these influences on their treatment decisions. Methods: Twenty medical trainees made treatment decisions (opioid, antidepressant, physical therapy) for 16 virtual patients with chronic low back pain; patient sex and race were manipulated across patients. Participants then indicated from a provided list the factors that influenced their treatment decisions, including patient demographics. Finally, individual interviews were conducted to discuss the role of patient demographics on providers' clinical decisions. Results: Individual regression analyses indicated that 30{\%} of participants were reliably influenced by patient sex and 15{\%} by patient race when making their decisions (P{\textless}0.05 or P{\textless}0.10). Group analyses indicated that white patients received higher antidepressant recommendations, on average, than black patients (P{\textless}0.05). Half of the medical trainees demonstrated awareness of the influence of demographic characteristics on their decision making. Participants, regardless of whether they were influenced by patients' demographics, discussed themes related to patient sex and race; however, participants' discussion of patient demographics in the interviews did not always align with their online study results. Conclusions: These findings suggest there is a considerable variability in the extent to which medical trainees are influenced by patient demographics and their awareness of these decision making influences.},

For the 632 largest cities in the world we construct panel data describing population, measures of centralization calculated from lights at night data, and the extent of each of the 138 subway systems in these cities. These data indicate that large cities are more likely to have subways but that subways have an economically insignificant effect on urban population growth. Our data also indicate that subways cause cities to decentralize, although the effect is smaller than previously documented effects of highways on decentralization. For a subset of subway cities we observe panel data describing subway and bus ridership. For those cities we find that a 10{\%} increase in subway extent causes about a 6{\%} increase in subway ridership and has no effect on bus ridership.},

In contrast to alternative DID estimators, our proposed estimators are consistent if either (but not necessarily both) a propensity score model or outcome regression models are correctly specified. In addition, our proposed methodology accommodates linear and nonlinear specifications, allows for treatment effect heterogeneity, and can be applied with either panel or repeated cross section data. We establish the asymptotic distribution of our proposed doubly robust estimators, and propose a computationally simple bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid inference. Our inference procedures directly account for multiple testing, and are therefore suitable in situations where researchers are interested in the effect of a given policy on many different outcomes. We demonstrate the relevance of our proposed policy evaluation tools in two different applications.},

abstract = {The gender ask gap measures the extent to which women ask for lower salaries than comparable men. This paper studies the role of the ask gap in generating wage inequality using novel data from Hired.com, a leading online recruitment platform for full time engineering jobs in the United States. To use the platform, job candidates must post an ask salary, stating how much they want to make in their next job. Firms then apply to candidates by offering a bid salary they are willing to pay the candidate. If the candidate is hired, a final salary is recorded. After adjusting for resume characteristics, the ask gap is 3.3{\%}, the bid gap is 2.4{\%} and the gap in final offers is 1.8{\%}. Remarkably, further controlling for the ask salary explains all of the gender gaps in bid and final salary on the platform. To estimate the market-level effects of an increase in women's ask salary, I exploit a sudden change in how candidates were prompted to provide their ask salary. For a subset of candidates, in mid-2018, the answer box used to solicit the ask salary went from an empty field to a pre-filled entry with the median salary on the platform for a similar candidate. Comparing candidates creating a profile before and after the feature change, I find that this change drove the ask gap and the bid gap to zero. In addition, women received the same number of bids before and after the change, suggesting they face little penalty for demanding wages comparable to men.},

abstract = {Background: Health care office staff and providers may discriminate against people of low socioeconomic status, even in the absence of economic incentives to do so. We sought to determine whether socioeconomic status affects the response a patient receives when seeking a primary care appointment.Methods: In a single unannounced telephone call to a random sample of family physicians and general practices (n = 375) in Toronto, Ontario, a male and a female researcher each played the role of a patient seeking a primary care physician. Callers followed a script suggesting either high (i.e., bank employee transferred to the city) or low (i.e., recipient of social assistance) socioeconomic status, and either the presence or absence of chronic health conditions (diabetes and low back pain). We randomized the characteristics of the caller for each office. Our primary outcome was whether the caller was offered an appointment.Results: The proportion of calls resulting in an appointment being offered was significantly higher when the callers presented themselves as having high socioeconomic status than when they presented as having low socioeconomic status (22.6{\%} v.14.3{\%}, p = 0.04) and when the callers stated the presence of chronic health conditions than when they did not (23.5{\%} v. 12.8{\%}, p = 0.008). In a model adjusted for all independent variables significant at a p value of 0.10 or less (presence of chronic health conditions, time since graduation from medical school and membership in the College of Family Physicians of Canada), high socioeconomic status was associated with an odds ratio of 1.78 (95{\%} confidence interval 1.02–3.08) for the offer of an appointment. Socioeconomic status and chronic health conditions had independent effects on the likelihood of obtaining an appointment.Interpretation: Within a universal health insurance system in which physician reimbursement is unaffected by patients' socioeconomic status, people presenting themselves as having high socioeconomic status received preferential access to primary care over those presenting themselves as having low socioeconomic status.},

@article{Baum-Snow2005,
abstract = {FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL governments have spent more than {\$}25 billion to establish or expand rail transit infrastructure in sixteen major U.S. metro-politan areas between 1970 and 2000. Billions more have been invested to maintain and improve existing rail transit lines. Despite the significant infra-structure improvements associated with these investments, transit ridership has been declining rapidly. The fraction of metropolitan area commuters in the United States using public transit declined from 0.12 in 1970 to 0.06 in 2000. Furthermore, only in a few metropolitan areas has transit increased its share of the commuting market since 1970, and in none of these areas did transit garner more than 10 percent of the market in 2000. In this paper, we evaluate the extent to which rail transit improvements have spurred new ridership and we provide some rough estimates of the value of these new commuting options. We demonstrate the importance of consid-ering heterogeneous responses of commuting mode choice both within and between metropolitan areas to the existence of new rail lines. For example, in each metropolitan area except Chicago, commuters living beyond ten kilo-meters of the city center and within two kilometers of a new rail transit line increased their transit use between 1970 and 2000. However, most metropol-itan areas saw declines in ridership within ten kilometers of the city center in areas near and far from new rail lines alike. Variation in metropolitan area structure is also key in determining whether new rail lines succeed at attract-ing riders. Rail transit is more likely to be successful in more densely popu-lated and centralized cities. Of the sixteen cities that significantly expanded their rail infrastructure after 1970, we find that Washington stands out as a place where rail transit investments have had relatively high returns. Finally, we find little evidence that significant ridership gains due to new rail lines continue to accrue more than a few years after construction is completed. Panel data at the census tract level allow us to evaluate the effects on rider-ship of new rail lines by making two types of comparisons. Exploitation of within metropolitan area variation in access allows for comparison of areas of each city that received new rail transit to equivalent areas that did not. Time series variation in transit access allows for comparison of the same census tract in each city over time. This difference-in-difference type comparison ultimately identifies our estimates of ridership gains as a result of new rail transit. Census data on commuting times and the number of rail, bus, and car commuters allow us to roughly calculate the number of commuting hours saved as a result of new rail transit construction. We develop a simple theoretical model that provides intuition about the spatial patterns in commuting mode choice adjustments that one may expect to see as result of new rail transit infrastructure. The implications of the model motivate the specifications used in public transit use regressions. These regres-sions incorporate potentially heterogeneous responses of public transit use to new rail infrastructure as a function of the year the system was built, distance to the city center, and physical structure of the metropolitan area as a whole. These regressions form the core empirical contribution of this paper. We use the regression estimates to evaluate the extent to which new rail transit causes people to change commuting modes, allowing us to roughly quantify the wel-fare benefits of recently constructed rail lines and to make some predictions about the likely success or failure of rail transit construction projects currently underway in several U.S. cities. Our study builds on earlier research investigating the consequences of rail transit investments. In a previous paper, we document that transit ridership saw less than average declines near new rail lines constructed in five U.S. cities during the 1980s. 1 On the other hand, metropolitan areas have been decentralizing such that existing transit infrastructure facilitates access to a smaller fraction of residents and employment. 2 This is reflected in falling 2 Brookings-Wharton Papers on Urban Affairs: 2005},

Natural experiment (NE) approaches are attracting growing interest as a way of providing evidence in such circumstances. One key challenge in evaluating NEs is selective exposure to the intervention. Studies should be based on a clear theoretical understanding of the processes that determine exposure. Even if the observed effects are large and rapidly follow implementation, confidence in attributing these effects to the intervention can be improved by carefully considering alternative explanations. Causal inference can be strengthened by including additional design features alongside the principal method of effect estimation. NE studies often rely on existing (including routinely collected) data. Investment in such data sources and the infrastructure for linking exposure and outcome data is essential if the potential for such studies to inform decision making is to be realized.},

This paper explores a legal constraint on mobility—employee non-compete agreements—by exploiting Michigan's apparently inadvertent 1985 reversal of its non-compete enforcement policy as a natural experiment. Using a differences-in-differences approach, and controlling for changes in the auto industry central to Michigan's economy, we find that the enforcement of non-competes indeed attenuates mobility. Moreover, noncompete enforcement decreases mobility more sharply for inventors with firm-specific skills and for those who specialize in narrow technical fields. The results speak to the literature on employee mobility while offering a credibly exogenous source of variation that can extend previous research on the implications of such mobility.},

Specifically, bisexual participants perceived bisexual targets as similar to heterosexual targets on the dimension of masculinity/femininity, rather than "in the middle" between heterosexual and homosexual targets. Further distinguishing their views from those of heterosexual and gay/lesbian participants, bisexual participants did not rate bisexual targets as especially indecisive, prone to nonmonogamy, focused on sex, or likely to cheat. These results help clarify the literature on stereotypes of sexual orientation groups. Prior work left open the possibility that stereotypes of bisexual people reflected a consensus view, including the opinions of bisexual people themselves, but our findings suggest otherwise. Addressing the often-overlooked point of view of bisexual people can reveal patterns of social attitudes that would otherwise escape notice.},

abstract = {Over 20 percent of prison and jail inmates in the United States are currently awaiting trial, but little is known about the impact of pretrial detention on defendants. This paper uses the detention tendencies of quasi-randomly assigned bail judges to estimate the causal effects of pretrial detention on subsequent defendant outcomes. Using data from administrative court and tax records, we find that pretrial detention significantly increases the probability of conviction, primarily through an increase in guilty pleas. Pretrial detention has no net effect on future crime, but decreases formal sector employment and the receipt of employment- and tax-related government benefits. These results are consistent with (i) pretrial detention weakening defendants' bargaining positions during plea negotiations and (ii) a criminal conviction lowering defendants' prospects in the formal labor market.

abstract = {Background and Objectives: Ageism is of increasing concern due to the growing older population worldwide and youth-centered focus of many societies. Research Design and Methods: The current investigation tested the PEACE (Positive Education about Aging and Contact Experiences) model for the first time. Two online experimental studies examined 2 key factors for reducing ageism: education about aging (providing accurate information about aging) and extended contact (knowledge of positive intergenerational contact) as well as their potential combined effect (education plus extended contact). Results and Discussion: In Study 1, 354 undergraduates in all 3 experimental conditions (vs. control participants) reported less negative attitudes toward older adults (delayed post-test) and greater aging knowledge (immediate and delayed post-tests), when controlling for pre-study attitudes. In Study 2, 505 national community participants (ages 18-59) in all experimental conditions (vs. control participants) reported less negative attitudes toward older adults (immediate post-test) and greater aging knowledge (immediate and delayed post-tests). In summary, across 2 online studies, education about aging and knowledge of intergenerational extended contact improved attitudes toward older adults and aging knowledge. Implications: Thus, brief, online ageism-reduction strategies can be an effective way to combat ageism. These strategies hold promise to be tested in other settings, with other samples, and to be elaborated into more in-depth interventions that aim to reduce ageism in everyday culture.},

Implicit measures might offer a valuable addition to self-report because they assess biased attitudes indirectly, do not rely on conscious introspection, and often demonstrate bias that contradicts self-reported attitudes. A sample (N = 105) of counselor trainees was assessed with measures of implicit bias toward African Americans and lesbians and gay men and a measure of self-reported multicultural competency. Implicit bias was present among counselor trainees despite high self-reported multicultural competency. In addition, self-reported multicultural competency varied by training level, but implicit bias did not. The results suggest that implicit bias can add to the understanding, assessment, and training of multicultural counselor competency. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all rights reserved).

One hundred fifty ethnically diverse lesbian, bisexual, queer, and other non-heterosexual-identified cisgender women completed a national online survey. Rates of sexual behavior over the past 6 months were high, including having sex with someone who had had many sexual partners (40.7{\%}), engaging in cunnilingus without protection (64{\%}), and having sex under the influence of substances (56.7{\%}). A canonical correlation found that heterosexist experiences and sexual behaviors had 20.7{\%} overlapping variance. Experiences of heterosexism by individuals in service jobs, strangers, or those in helping professions were tied to engagement in more impulsive sexual behaviors. Multiple linear regressions found that heterosexism explained 19.3{\%} of the variance in impulsive sexual behaviors, 8.6{\%} in sex with uncommitted partners, and 8.8{\%} in intent to engage in sexual behaviors. Despite the high rates of sexual behavior found in this study, a focus on sexual behaviors among SMW has largely been omitted from health research. Based on the current findings, interventions for addressing sexual behaviors in SMW as well as future research directions are discussed.},

In contrast to prior findings, public housing officials respond at equal rates to black and white email requests.

Hispanic housing applicants were 20 percentage points less likely to be greeted by name than were their black and white counterparts. This disparity in tone is somewhat more muted in more diverse locations, but it does not depend on whether a housing official is Hispanic.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: African-American patients who visit physicians of the same race rate their medical visits as more satisfying and participatory than do those who see physicians of other races. Little research has investigated the communication process in race-concordant and race-discordant medical visits. OBJECTIVES: To compare patient-physician communication in race-concordant and race-discordant visits and examine whether communication behaviors explain differences in patient ratings of satisfaction and participatory decision making. DESIGN: Cohort study with follow-up using previsit and postvisit surveys and audiotape analysis. SETTING: 16 urban primary care practices. PATIENTS: 252 adults (142 African-American patients and 110 white patients) receiving care from 31 physicians (of whom 18 were African-American and 13 were white). MEASUREMENTS: Audiotape measures of patient-centeredness, patient ratings of physicians' participatory decision-making styles, and overall satisfaction. RESULTS: Race-concordant visits were longer (2.15 minutes [95{\%} CI, 0.60 to 3.71]) and had higher ratings of patient positive affect (0.55 point, [95{\%} CI, 0.04 to 1.05]) compared with race-discordant visits. Patients in race-concordant visits were more satisfied and rated their physicians as more participatory (8.42 points [95{\%} CI, 3.23 to 13.60]). Audiotape measures of patient-centered communication behaviors did not explain differences in participatory decision making or satisfaction between race-concordant and race-discordant visits. CONCLUSIONS: Race-concordant visits are longer and characterized by more patient positive affect. Previous studies link similar communication findings to continuity of care. The association between race concordance and higher patient ratings of care is independent of patient-centered communication, suggesting that other factors, such as patient and physician attitudes, may mediate the relationship. Until more evidence is available regarding the mechanisms of this relationship and the effectiveness of intercultural communication skills programs, increasing ethnic diversity among physicians may be the most direct strategy to improve health care experiences for members of ethnic minority groups.},

abstract = {A regression kink design (RKD or RK design) can be used to identify casual effects in settings where the regressor of interest is a kinked function of an assignment variable. In this chapter, we apply an RKD approach to study the effect of unemployment benefits on the duration of joblessness in Austria, and discuss implementation issues that may arise in similar settings, including the use of bandwidth selection algorithms and bias-correction procedures. Although recent developments in nonparametric estimation (Calonico, Cattaneo, {\&} Farrell, 2014; Imbens {\&} Kalyanaraman, 2012) are sometimes interpreted by practitioners as pointing to a default estimation procedure, we show that in any given application different procedures may perform better or worse. In particular, Monte Carlo simulations based on data-generating processes that closely resemble the data from our application show that some asymptotically dominant procedures may actually perform worse than "suboptimal" alternatives in a given empirical application.},

abstract = {Until the middle of the 1970's, regulations constrained banks' ability to enter new markets. Over the subsequent 25 years, states gradually lifted these restrictions. This paper tests whether rents fostered by regulation were shared with labor, and whether firms were discriminating by sharing these rents disproportionately with male workers. We find that average compensation and average wages for banking employees fell after states deregulated. Male wages fell by about 12 percent after deregulation, whereas women's wages fell by only 3 percent, suggesting that rents were shared mainly with men. Women's share of employment in managerial positions also increased following deregulation.

We sent job applications from three pairs of candidates to the same job advertisements in the French financial sector between January and March 2002, focusing on low-skilled administrative or commercial jobs and high-skilled administrative or commercial jobs. Within each pair, the applicants' characteristics were similar except for gender. We compare the gender gap in access to job interviews for single and childless applicants aged 25 and 37. We find significant hiring discrimination against women aged 25 applying for high-skilled administrative jobs. Young men are preferred to young women when employers offer long-term contracts. Among single and childless applicants aged 37, we find no significant hiring discrimination against women. We then compare the gender job-access gap for applicants aged 37 who are single and childless or married with three children.

abstract = {Using a novel database of 82.5 million online job postings, we show that employer skill requirements fell as the labor market improved from 2010 to 2014. We find that a 1 percentage point reduction in the local unemployment rate is associated with a roughly 0.27 percentage point reduction in the fraction of jobs requiring at least a bachelor's degree and a roughly 0.23 percentage point reduction in the fraction requiring five or more years of experience. This pattern is established using multiple measures of labor availability, is bolstered by similar trends along heretofore un-measured dimensions of skill, and even occurs within firm-job title pairs. We further confirm the causal effect of labor market tightening on skill requirements using a natural experiment based on the fracking boom in the United States, as an exogenous shock to the local labor supply in tradable, non-fracking industries. These industries are not plausibly affected by local demand shocks or natural gas extraction technology, but still show fewer skill requirements in response to tighter labor markets. Our results imply this labor market-induced downskilling reversed much of the cyclical increase in education and experience requirements that occurred during the Great Recession.},

Instead, if the number of clusters is large, statistical inference after OLS should be based on cluster-robust standard errors.

This study measured implicit and explicit attitudes about race using the Race Attitude Implicit Association Test (IAT) for a large sample of test takers (N=404,277), including a sub-sample of medical doctors (MDs) (n=2,535). Medical doctors, like the entire sample, showed an implicit preference for White Americans relative to Black Americans. We examined these effects among White, African American, Hispanic, and Asian MDs and by physician gender. Strength of implicit bias exceeded self-report among all test takers except African American MDs. African American MDs, on average, did not show an implicit preference for either Blacks or Whites, and women showed less implicit bias than men. Future research should explore whether, and under what conditions, MDs' implicit attitudes about race affect the quality of medical care.},

abstract = {On January 17th 2007, a bill was re-introduced by Senator Daniel Akaka (D- Hawai`i) to provide a process of granting tribal sovereignty to Native Hawaiians as the indigenous people of Hawai`i, a similar status afforded Native American tribes on the continental United States. The difference, however, is that Native Hawaiians are citizens of an internationally recognized sovereign, but occupied State, whereas Native Americans are a dependent nation within the sovereign State of the United States. Great Britain and France were the first to recognize Hawai`i's sovereignty on November 28th 1843 by joint proclamation, and the United States followed on July 6th 1844 by letter of United States Secretary of State John C. Calhoun. This dissertation reframes the legal status of the Hawaiian Islands by employing legal and political theories that seek to explain Hawaiian modernity and international relations since the 19th century to the present. As an alternative to the view of U.S. sovereignty exercised by virtue of the plenary power of Congress over indigenous peoples, this dissertation challenges the core assumptions about the history of law and politics in the Hawaiian Islands by providing a legal analysis of Hawaiian sovereignty under international law that clearly explicates Hawai`i's occupation by the United States since the Spanish American War. In terms of law, this study looks at the origin and development of the Hawaiian Kingdom as a constitutional monarchy, the events that led to the illegal overthrow of its government, the prolonged occupation of its territory, and a strategy to impel the United States to comply with the international laws of occupation with the ultimate goal of ending the prolonged occupation.},

We conducted four randomized field experiments among 1,801 hosts on Airbnb by creating fictitious guest accounts and sending accommodation requests to them. We find that requests from guests with African American-sounding names are 19.2 percentage points less likely to be accepted than those with white-sounding names. However, a positive review posted on a guest's page significantly reduces discrimination: when guest accounts receive a positive review, the acceptance rates of guest accounts with white- and African American-sounding names are statistically indistinguishable. We further show that a nonpositive review and a blank review without any content can also help attenuate discrimination, but self-claimed information on tidiness and friendliness cannot reduce discrimination, which indicates the importance of encouraging credible peer-generated reviews. Our results offer direct and clear guidance for sharing-economy platforms to reduce discrimination.},

abstract = {This article reports findings of an experiment motivated by a dynamic labor market model that considers the problem faced by employers in making hiring decisions between workers of different types. The question examined here is how quickly employers learn about the ability of a group of workers through observing representatives of that group. If prior opinions are weak, the employer will use information from the workplace to quickly update any incorrect group-based stereotypes it may have. On the other hand, if priors are heavily weighted, incorrect initial perceptions will result in persistent wage differences. Our experimental findings are twofold. First, subjects' (employers') behavior moves quickly toward optimal choices. Second, strong priors are hard to establish. These results suggest that it would take a long time for employers to form group-based stereotypes and that such stereotypes should go away quickly in response to signals that contradict these stereotypes.},

abstract = {Measuring sexual orientation, behavior, and related opinions is difficult because responses are biased towards socially acceptable answers. We test whether measurements are biased even when responses are private and anonymous and use our results to identify sexuality-related norms and how they vary. We run an experiment on 2,516 U.S. participants. Participants were randomly assigned to either a " best practices method " that was computer-based and provides privacy and anonymity, or to a " veiled elicitation method " that further conceals individual responses. Answers in the veiled method preclude inference about any particular individual, but can be used to accurately estimate statistics about the population. Comparing the two methods shows sexuality-related questions receive biased responses even under current best practices, and, for many questions, the bias is substantial. The veiled method increased self-reports of non-heterosexual identity by 65{\%} (p{\textless}0.05) and same-sex sexual experiences by 59{\%} (p{\textless}0.01). The veiled method also increased the rates of anti-gay sentiment. Respondents were 67{\%} more likely to express disapproval of an openly gay manager at work (p{\textless}0.01) and 71{\%} more likely to say it is okay to discriminate against lesbian, gay, or bisexual individuals (p{\textless}0.01). The results show non-heterosexuality and anti-gay sentiment are substantially underestimated in existing surveys, and the privacy afforded by current best practices is not always sufficient to eliminate bias. Finally, our results identify two social norms: it is perceived as socially undesirable both to be open about being gay, and to be unaccepting of gay individuals.},

abstract = {This article presents the first report of basic findings from the 2020 online administration of the sixth national quinquennial survey on teaching and assessment methods. Focusing on the teaching methods in introductory economics courses (i.e., principles and survey courses), the authors find that very little has changed in the past quarter-century. The typical instructor in introductory courses is predominantly a male, Caucasian, with a PhD. “Chalk and Talk” remains the preferred method of instruction in introductory courses, along with the use of textbooks. The use of “student(s) with student(s)” discussions in the classroom, as well as cooperative learning/small-group assignments, has increased since 2010. Lessons, activities, and references that address diversity, inclusion, or gender issues, however, are almost never used in introductory economics courses.JEL Classifications: A20, A22},

abstract = {Fair housing audits or tests, which compare the way housing agents treat equally quali- fied homeseekers in different racial or ethnic groups, are an important tool both for en- forcing fair housing laws and for studying discriminatory behavior in housing markets. This article explains the features of two types of housing audits: in-person paired audits and correspondence audits, which are usually conducted over the Internet. In addition, this article reviews evidence provided by audit studies about the extent of housing discrimi- nation. The studies reviewed include four national studies in the United States based on in-person audits and many studies based on correspondence audits in the United States and in several European countries. This article also reviews audit-based evidence about the causes of discrimination in housing markets. Despite variation in methods, sample sizes, and locations, audit studies consistently find evidence of statistically significant discrimination against homeseekers who belong to a historically disadvantaged racial or ethnic group. The 2012 national audit study found, for example, that the share of audits in which a White homebuyer was shown more available houses than an equally quali- fied Black homebuyer was 9 percentage points higher than the share in which the Black homebuyer was shown more houses than his or her White counterpart. In the United States, housing discrimination against Black and Hispanic homeseekers appears to have declined in some types of agent behavior, such as whether the advertised unit is shown to a customer, but to have increased in others, such as steering Black and Hispanic homeseekers toward minority neighborhoods. This article also discusses the past use and continued importance of fair housing audits as a fair-housing-enforcement tool. Cityscape:},

abstract = {Who was in charge of the widespread provinces of the great Inka Empire of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries: Inka from the imperial heartland or local leaders who took on the trappings of their conquerors, either by coercion or acceptance? By focusing on provinces far from the capital of Cuzco, the essays in this multidisciplinary volume provide up-to-date information on the strategies of domination asserted by the Inka across the provinces far from their capital and the equally broad range of responses adopted by their conquered peoples. Contributors to this cutting-edge volume incorporate the interaction of archaeological and ethnohistorical research with archaeobotany, biometrics, architecture, and mining engineering, among other fields. The geographical scope of the chapters—which cover the Inka provinces in Bolivia, in southeast Argentina, in southern Chile, along the central and north coast of Peru, and in Ecuador—build upon the many different ways in which conqueror and conquered interacted. Competing factors such as the kinds of resources available in the provinces, the degree of cooperation or resistance manifested by local leaders, the existing levels of political organization convenient to the imperial administration, and how recently a region had been conquered provide a wealth of information on regions previously understudied. Using detailed contextual analyses of Inka and elite residences and settlements in the distant provinces, the essayists evaluate the impact of the empire on the leadership strategies of conquered populations, whether they were Inka by privilege, local leaders acculturated to Inka norms, or foreign mid-level administrators from trusted ethnicities. By exploring the critical interface between local elites and their Inka overlords, Distant Provinces in the Inka Empire builds upon Malpass's 1993 Provincial Inca: Archaeological and Ethnohistorical Assessment of the Impact of the Inca State to support the conclusions that Inka strategies of control were tailored to the particular situations faced in different regions. By contributing to our understanding of what it means to be marginal in the Inka Empire, this book details how the Inka attended to their political and economic goals in their interactions with their conquered peoples and how their subjects responded, producing a richly textured view of the reality that was the Inka Empire.},

abstract = {It is well documented that individuals in couples tend to retire around the same time. But because women tend to marry older men, this means many married women retire at younger ages than their husbands. This fact is somewhat at odds with lifecycle theory that suggests women might otherwise retire at later ages than men because they have longer life expectancies, and often have had shorter careers on account of childrearing. As a result, the opportunity cost of retirement—in terms of foregone potential earnings and accruals to Social Security wealth—may be larger for married women than for their husbands. Using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), I find evidence that the returns to additional work beyond mid-life are greater for married women than for married men. The potential gain in Social Security wealth alone is enough to place married women on nearly equal footing with married men in terms of Social Security wealth at age 70.},

abstract = {We examine two different ways to subsidize charitable giving: by a rebate (returning a portion of the donation to the giver) or by a match (adding additional donations to the giver's donation). In previous experimental research, we have shown that participants give more to charity under the match than under an equivalent rebate. The previous within-subject experimental design required participants to make a series of decisions under both types of subsidy. Each decision consisted of an allocation of an endowment between the subject and a charity chosen by the subject from a specified list. This article examines whether that result is an artifact of the previous within-subjects design: subjects may have failed to fully distinguish the two types of subsidy. In the current article, we report results from a between-subjects design, where participants are required to make only one type of decision— involving rebates or involving matching subsidies. Our results confirm previous findings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

However, causal inference poses many challenges in DID designs. In this article, we review key features of DID designs with an emphasis on public health policy research. Contemporary researchers should take an active approach to the design ofDIDstudies, seeking to construct comparison groups, sensitivity analyses, and robustness checks that help validate the method's assumptions. We explain the key assumptions of the design and discuss analytic tactics, supplementary analysis, and approaches to statistical inference that are often important in applied research. The DID design is not a perfect substitute for randomized experiments, but it often represents a feasible way to learn about casual relationships. We conclude by noting that combining elements from multiple quasi-experimental techniques may be important in the next wave of innovations to the DID approach.},

We harness rich data taken from multiple sources, including matched employer-employee data with which we measure the strength of labor market networks, data on behavior such as voting patterns that have previously been tied to social capital, and new data – not previously used in the study of social capital – on the number and location of non-profits at the neighborhood level. We use a machine learning algorithm to identify potential social capital measures that best predict neighborhood-level variation in labor market networks. We find evidence suggesting that smaller and less centralized schools, and schools with fewer poor students, foster social capital that builds labor market networks, as does a larger Republican vote share. The presence of establishments in a number of non-profit oriented industries are identified as predictive of strong labor market networks, likely because they either provide public goods or facilitate social contacts. These industries include, for example, churches and other religious institutions, schools, country clubs, and amateur or recreational sports teams or clubs.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The transition from medical school to residency is a critical step in the careers of physicians. Because of the standardized application process-wherein schools submit summative Medical Student Performance Evaluations (MSPE's)-it also represents a unique opportunity to assess the possible prevalence of racial and gender disparities, as shown elsewhere in medicine. METHOD: The authors conducted textual analysis of MSPE's from 6,000 US students applying to 16 residency programs at a single institution in 2014-15. They used custom software to extract demographic data and keyword frequency from each MSPE. The main outcome measure was the proportion of applicants described using 24 pre-determined words from four thematic categories ("standout traits", "ability", "grindstone habits", and "compassion"). RESULTS: The data showed significant differences based on race and gender. White applicants were more likely to be described using "standout" or "ability" keywords (including "exceptional", "best", and "outstanding") while Black applicants were more likely to be described as "competent". These differences remained significant after controlling for United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 scores. Female applicants were more frequently described as "caring", "compassionate", and "empathic" or "empathetic". Women were also more frequently described as "bright" and "organized". CONCLUSIONS: While the MSPE is intended to reflect an objective, summative assessment of students' qualifications, these data demonstrate for the first time systematic differences in how candidates are described based on racial/ethnic and gender group membership. Recognizing possible implicit biases and their potential impact is important for faculty who strive to create a more egalitarian medical community.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze Medicare Part D's net effect on elderly patients' use of and out-of-pocket (OOP) costs for prescription drugs and to compare these with standardized results from prior studies. STUDY DESIGN: Our dataset contains 1.4 billion prescriptions from Wolters Kluwer Health from December 2004 through December 2007 for patients whose age as of 2007 was more than 57 years. METHODS: Days' supply per capita, OOP cost per day's supply, and number of individuals filling prescriptions were compared before and after January 2006 for those over age 66 years versus those age 58-64 years. Adjustment was made for under-reporting of pure cash prescriptions in the data. RESULTS: Elderly patients' utilization in the first year of Part D increased compared with that of near-elderly patients by 8.1{\%} for days' supply and 4.8{\%} for the number of individuals filling prescriptions, and their OOP costs declined by 17.2{\%}. Although elderly patients' OOP costs in the second year were reduced an additional 5.8{\%}, days' supply increased by only an additional 1.0{\%}. Correcting for the under-reporting of pure cash prescriptions yielded effects of 8.1{\%} and -3.5{\%} for days' supply and -15.6{\%} and -7.2{\%} for OOP costs in 2006 and 2007, respectively. A standardized comparison with previous estimates from Walgreens data showed that our utilization estimates were 2.6 times larger. CONCLUSION: Part D lowered elderly patients' OOP costs and increased utilization, primarily during the first year of the program. Magnitudes vary substantially across studies because of differences in data and methods.},

Assuming a known assignment mechanism for units close to the RD cutoff, these functions implement a variety of procedures based on randomization inference techniques. First, the rdrandinf command uses randomization methods to conduct point estimation, hypothesis testing, and confidence interval estimation under different assumptions. Second, the rdwinselect command uses finite-sample methods to select a window near the cutoff where the assumption of randomized treatment assignment is most plausible. Third, the rdsensitivity command uses randomization techniques to conduct a sequence of hypothesis tests for different windows around the RD cutoff, which can be used to assess the sensitivity of the methods and to construct confidence intervals by inversion. Finally, the rdrbounds command implements Rosenbaum (2002, Observational Studies [Springer]) sensitivity bounds for the context of RD designs under local randomization. Companion R functions with the same syntax and capabilities are also provided.},

abstract = {A main goal of health insurance is to smooth out the financial risk that comes with health shocks and health care. Nevertheless, there has been relatively sparse evidence on how health insurance affects financial outcomes. The few studies that exist focus on the effect of gaining health insurance. This paper explores the effect of losing public health insurance on measures of individual financial well-being. In 2005, the state of Tennessee dropped about 170,000 individuals from Medicaid, resulting in a plausibly exogenous shock to health insurance status. Both across-and within-county variation in the size of the disenrollment is linked with individual-level credit risk score and debt data to identify the effects. The results suggest that the disenrollment resulted in a 1.73 point decline in credit risk scores for the median individual in Tennessee. There is also evidence of increases in the amount and share of delinquent debt (90 days past due or more) and of increases in bankruptcy risk. These findings are mostly concentrated among individuals who were in relatively worse financial status before the disenrollment and suggest that there are significant negative consequences to current recipients that would need to be considered in the cost and benefit calculations around rollbacks of recent Medicaid expansions.},

There seems to be little experimentation with alternative pedagogies or assessment techniques despite an in-creasing amount of attention to these issues in recent years.},

abstract = {Women outnumber men in undergraduate enrollments, but they are much less likely than men to major in mathematics or science or to choose a profession in these fields. This outcome often is attributed to the effects of negative sex-based stereotypes. We studied the effect of such stereotypes in an experimental market, where subjects were hired to perform an arithmetic task that, on average, both genders perform equally well. We find that without any information other than a candidate's appearance (which makes sex clear), both male and female subjects are twice more likely to hire a man than a woman. The discrimination survives if performance on the arithmetic task is self-reported, because men tend to boast about their performance, whereas women generally underreport it. The discrimination is reduced, but not eliminated, by providing full information about previous performance on the task. By using the Implicit Association Test, we show that implicit stereotypes are responsible for the initial average bias in sex-related beliefs and for a bias in updating expectations when performance information is self-reported. That is, employers biased against women are less likely to take into account the fact that men, on average, boast more than women about their future performance, leading to suboptimal hiring choices that remain biased in favor of men.},

abstract = {Purpose: Top managers guide organizational strategy and practices, but their role in the employment of older workers is understudied. We study the effects that age-related workplace norms of top managers have on organizations' recruitment and retention practices regarding older workers. We investigate two types of age-related workplace norms, namely age equality norms (whether younger and older workers should be treated equally) and retirement age norms (when older workers are expected to retire) while controlling for organizational and national contexts. Data and methods: Data collected among top managers of 1,088 organizations from six European countries were used for the study. Logistic regression models were run to estimate the effects of age-related workplace norms on four different organizational outcomes: (a) recruiting older workers, (b) encouraging working until normal retirement age, (c) encouraging working beyond normal retirement age, and (d) rehiring retired former employees. Results: Age-related workplace norms of top managers affect their organizations' practices, but in different ways. Age equality norms positively affect practices before the boundary of normal retirement age (Outcomes a and b), whereas retirement age norms positively affect practices after the boundary of normal retirement age (Outcomes c and d). Implications: Changing age-related workplace norms of important actors in organizations may be conducive to better employment opportunities and a higher level of employment participation of older workers. However, care should be taken to target the right types of norms, since targeting different norms may yield different outcomes.},

The American institutional setting--particularly the party system and the registration laws--severely inhibits voter turnout, and probably also accounts for the unusual degree to which education and other socioeconomic resources are directly linked to voting participation in the United States. Using a combination of aggregate and comparative survey data, the present analysis suggests that in comparative perspective, turnout in the United States is advantaged about 5{\%} by political attitudes, but disadvantaged 13{\%} by the party system and institutional factors, and up to 14{\%} by the registration laws. The experience of other democracies suggests that encouraging voter participation would contribute to channeling discontent through the electoral process. Even a significantly expanded American electorate would be more interested and involved in political activity than are present voters in most other democracies.},

We examined the possible role of perceived discrimination in generating that risk. METHODS The National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States, a nationally representative sample of adults aged 25 to 74 years, surveyed individuals self-identifying as homosexual or bisexual (n = 73) or heterosexual (n = 2844) about their lifetime and day-to-day experiences with discrimination. Also assessed were 1-year prevalence of depressive, anxiety, and substance dependence disorders; current psychologic distress; and self-rated mental health. RESULTS Homosexual and bisexual individuals more frequently than heterosexual persons reported both lifetime and day-to-day experiences with discrimination. Approximately 42{\%} attributed this to their sexual orientation, in whole or part. Perceived discrimination was positively associated with both harmful effects on quality of life and indicators of psychiatric morbidity in the total sample. Controlling for differences in discrimination experiences attenuated observed associations between psychiatric morbidity and sexual orientation. CONCLUSIONS Higher levels of discrimination may underlie recent observations of greater psychiatric morbidity risk among lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals.},

An important feature of the SC method is the inferential procedures based on placebo studies, suggested in Abadie et al. (2010). In this paper, we evaluate the statistical properties of these inferential techniques. We first show that the graphical analysis with placebos can be misleading, as placebo runs with lower expected squared prediction errors would still be considered in the analysis. Then we show that a test based on the the post/pre-intervention mean squared prediction error, as suggested in Abadie et al. (2010), ameliorates this problem. However, we show that such test can still have some size distortions, even if we consider a case in which the test statistic has the same marginal distribution for all placebo runs. Finally, we show that the fact that the SC weights are estimated can lead to important additional size distortions.},

abstract = {Peer to Peer e-commerce is increasingly characterized by trends towards the personalization of buyers and sellers in the on-line marketplace. This personalization includes buyer reviews, personal pictures and profiles, and other biographical information intended to reduce buyers' perceived “purchase risk” or to facilitate trust in the sellers. However, this phenomenon is transforming what started as an essentially “anonymous” market to one susceptible to traditional market failures, including potential racial discrimination, in a manner similar to its brick and mortar counterparts. In this paper, we examine the effect of on-line host information (race, gender, sexual orientation, etc.) on the price of available rental listings in San Francisco on Airbnb.com. We find that on average, Asian and Hispanic hosts charge 8{\%}-10{\%} lower prices relative to their White counterparts on equivalent rental properties, after controlling for all renter-available information on rental unit characteristics, as well as additional information on neighborhood property values, area demographics, and occupancy rates. We do not find any differences in occupancy rates between minority and White hosts. This may suggest that minorities price lower because they are forward-looking, perhaps due to an expectation of discrimination in the online marketplace or have a preference to increase demand to either maintain their target occupancy level or to attract a larger pool of potential renters to choose from. Overall, our findings are consistent with but not conclusive of a market test of potential racial discrimination affecting Hispanic Airbnb hosts, manifested in an anticipation of disparate market demand for their rentals, and responded to by lower listing prices.},

Also as predicted, the type of information provided had more impact on reactions to female applicants than male applicants, with high job-relevance information producing the most favorable responses and, unexpectedly, low job-relevance information producing the least favorable responses to female applicants. Additional results suggested that these effects were mediated by the degree to which female job applicants were characterized by stereotypic attributes. The findings are interpreted as supportive of the idea that undermining the information value of sex stereotypes as a basis of inference about the attributes of a given woman can function to reduce sex discrimination in employment settings. ?? 1984.},

Since the onset of the pandemic, mental illness has increased and demand for resources and services are on the rise. COVID-19 has served as a catalyst for the rapid implementation and acceptance of telemental health as a psychological service delivery option. Telemental health has several benefits, including increased reach and accessibility for those living in rural areas, reduced treatment attrition, and cost savings due to reduced travel. Although telemental health may be an innovative solution for broadly delivering psychological services, it can also pose threats to confidentiality and is limited to individuals with accessibility to the Internet and capability to navigate online platforms. Telemental health may also not be appropriate for individuals with severe mental illness (e.g., active psychosis, suicidality), who require in-person services to mitigate acute risk, or in situations in which a high degree of confidentiality is critical for accurate disclosure (e.g., child maltreatment, domestic violence). In this commentary, we describe the benefits and challenges of telemental health, and also highlight important considerations for clinicians, children and youth, systems that coordinate and facilitate mental health services, and future research. We conclude that telemental health is not a panacea and requires careful consideration for appropriateness depending on client needs and confidentiality, and standards for ensuring optimal outcomes for clients.

Despite the theoretical prominence of this idea, there is little systematic evidence in support of its empirical relevance. This paper exploits the division of Ger- many afterWorldWar II and the reunification of East andWest Germany as an exogenous shock to industry location. Focusing on a particular economic activity, an air hub, we develop a body of evidence that the relocation of Germany's air hub from Berlin to Frankfurt in response to division is a shift between multiple steady states.},

The data for the study were gathered among 796 managers. Through principal components analysis, 15 opinions about older workers were reduced to three dimensions of stereotypes. The first dimension deals with the productivity of older staff; the other two dimensions have to do with their reliability and their adaptability. These stereotypical ideas about older workers influence managers' attitudes toward the retirement of their employees. The analyses show that, besides organizational factors, psychological mechanisms also explain why people view older workers through stereotypes. Managers who are older and in more frequent contact with older employees tend to hold more positive views.},

The weakness of PSM comes from its attempts to approximate a completely randomized experiment, rather than, as with other matching methods, a more efficient fully blocked randomized experiment. PSM is thus uniquely blind to the often large portion of imbalance that can be eliminated by approximating full blocking with other matching methods. Moreover, in data balanced enough to approximate complete randomization, either to begin with or after pruning some observations, PSM approximates random matching which, we show, increases imbalance even relative to the original data. Although these results suggest researchers replace PSM with one of the other available matching methods, propensity scores have other productive uses.},

abstract = {Background: Previous studies indicate that depressed patients with partial remission and residual symptoms following antidepressant treatment are common and have high rates of relapse. There is evidence that cognitive therapy may reduce relapse rates in depression. Methods: One hundred fifty- eight patients with recent major depression, partially remitted with antidepressant treatment (mean daily doses equivalent to 185 mg of amitriptyline or 33 mg of fluoxetine) but with residual symptoms of 2 to 18 months' duration, were included in a controlled trial. Subjects were randomized to receive clinical management alone or clinical management plus cognitive therapy for 16 sessions during 20 weeks, with 2 subsequent booster sessions. Subjects were assessed regularly throughout the 20 weeks' treatment and for a further year. They received continuation and maintenance antidepressants at the same dose throughout. Results: Cognitive therapy reduced relapse rates for acute major depression and persistent severe residual symptoms, in both intention to treat and treated per protocol samples. The cumulative relapse rate at 68 weeks was reduced significantly, from 47{\%} in the clinical management control group to 29{\%} with cognitive therapy (hazard ratio 0.54; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.32-0.93; intention to treat analysis). Cognitive therapy also increased full remission rates at 20 weeks but did not significantly improve symptom ratings. Conclusion: In this difficult-to-treat group of patients with residual depression who showed only partial response despite antidepressant treatment, cognitive therapy produced worthwhile benefit.},

Together, these commands are useful when devising new experiments or surveys in regression-discontinuity designs, which will later be analyzed using modern local polynomial techniques for estimation, inference, and falsification. Because our commands use the communitycontributed (and R) package rdrobust for the underlying bandwidths, biases, and variances estimation, all the options currently available in rdrobust can also be used for power calculations and sample-size selection, including preintervention covariate adjustment, clustered sampling, and many bandwidth selectors.

We go beyond health risk alone to quantify the overall insurance value of U.S. disability programs, including value from insuring non-health risk. We find that disability recipients, especially those with less-severe health conditions, are much more likely to have experienced a wide variety of non-health shocks than non-recipients. Selection into disability receipt on the basis of non-health shocks is so strong among individuals with less-severe health conditions that by many measures less-severe recipients are worse off than more-severe recipients. As a result, under baseline assumptions, benefits to less-severe recipients have an annual surplus value (insurance benefit less efficiency cost) over cost-equivalent tax cuts of {\$}7,700 per recipient, about three-fourths that of benefits to more-severe recipients ({\$}9,900). Insurance against non-health risk accounts for about one-half of the value of U.S. disability programs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent reports speculate that provider implicit attitudes about race may contribute to racial/ethnic health care disparities. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that implicit racial bias exists among pediatricians, implicit and explicit measures would differ and implicit measures may be related to quality of care. RESEARCH DESIGN: A single-session, Web survey of academic pediatricians in an urban university measured implicit racial attitudes and stereotypes using a measure of implicit social cognition, the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Explicit (overt) attitudes were measured by self-report. Case vignettes were used to assess quality of care. RESULTS: We found an implicit preference for European Americans relative to African Americans, which was weaker than implicit measures for others in society (mean IAT score = 0.18; P = 0.01; Cohen's d = 0.41). Physicians held an implicit association between European Americans relative to African Americans and the concept of "compliant patient" (mean IAT score = 0.25; P = 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.60) and for African Americans relative to European Americans and the concept of "preferred medical care" (mean IAT score =-0.21; P = 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.64). Medical care differed by patient race in 1 of 4 case vignettes. No significant relationship was found between implicit and explicit measures, or implicit measures and treatment recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatricians held less implicit race bias compared with other MDs and others in society. Among pediatricians we found evidence of a moderate implicit "perceived patient compliance and race" stereotype. Further research is needed to explore whether physician implicit attitudes and stereotypes about race predict quality of care.},

A new test for serial correlation in random- or fixed-effects one-way models derived by Wooldridge (2002) is attractive because it can be applied under general conditions and is easy to implement. This paper presents simulation evidence that the new Wooldridge test has good size and power properties in reasonably sized samples.},

abstract = {The "crime drop" is the most important criminological phenomenon of modern times. In North America, Europe, and Australasia, many common crimes have fallen by half or more since the early 1990s, albeit with variation in the specifics. Seventeen explanations are examined here including demographics, policing, imprisonment, drug markets, and lead poisoning. Pioneering research relevant only to the United States now appears, with the benefit of hindsight, somewhat parochial. Sixteen of the 17 hypotheses fail one or more of four evidence-based standardized tests on which they are assessed. The one that passes is the security hypothesis, underpinned by crime opportunity theories. Here there is strong evidence that vehicle theft fell because of more and better security, and mounting evidence that improved security was critical in reducing burglary and other acquisitive crime. Many crime types are interrelated, while most criminal careers are dominated by property crime, so removing these volume crimes might be expected to reduce violence.},

The plant-specific characteristics derive from a study of Fortune 500 plants that were opened in the 1970s. A number of relationships are derived from considerations of expected profitability that relate site selection to state and firm characteristics. These are tested through a series of multinomial logit models. The results confirm that the plant location decision can be usefully approached as a staged process and that geographically defined differences are not sufficient, by themselves, to explain why some states do better than others in attracting new plants. When plant-specific characteristics are used to modify the state-based factors, the explanation becomes much richer and more powerful.},

Although there are no gender differences in performance, men select the tournament twice as much as women when choosing their compensation scheme for the next performance. While 73 percent of the men select the tournament, only 35 percent of the women make this choice. This gender gap in tournament entry is not explained by performance, and factors such as risk and feedback aversion only play a negligible role. Instead, the tournament-entry gap is driven by men being more overconfident and by gender differences in preferences for performing in a competition. The result is that women shy away from competition and men embrace it.},

Under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, individuals have challenged de facto discriminatory policies adopted by health entities receiving federal financial assistance. Title VI health litigation is difficult because of complex issues of proof as well as confounding problems of poverty and lack of health insurance that affect both claims and remedies. An analysis of cases brought under the law suggests that discrimination claims within a particular market fare better than those challenging decisions to relocate or alter the market served. This has important implications for claims involving discrimination by managed care organizations. Because the same potential for discrimination exists in the new health system of managed care, although in altered form, data collection and evaluation are warranted.},

Following an overview of the nature and scope of the Great Recession, the labor market experiences of persons with and without disability are compared for 16 of the 22 months of its duration. Differences which favor those without disabilities were detected in the labor market activity rate, the official unemployment rate, and in the desire for work among those who have quit the workforce. These differences persist among subgroups based upon age and educational attainment. The level of educational attainment appears to not provide the same level of insulation from the consequences of labor market downturns for persons with disabilities as it does for persons without disabilities.

abstract = {Background: Previous studies have shown long wait-times for general dermatology patients seeking routine appointments. No evidence has been gathered on wait-times for patients with urgent problems or on the impact of physician extenders on access to dermatologic care. Objective and Methods: To evaluate access for patients with an urgent problem, we performed scripted patient telephone calls to 851 dermatologists to assess wait-times for both patients with Medicare and those paying out-of-pocket complaining of a changing mole. Results: Mean wait-times were similarly long for patients paying out-of-pocket (38.2 days) and those on Medicare (38.9 days; P = .85). Acceptance rates and wait-times varied greatly by geographic area (range of mean wait-times, 19.7-73.4 days). Many dermatologists (23.3{\%}) employed a physician extender, and the wait-times for these extenders (27.9 days) were significantly shorter than those for the physicians supervising them (45.8 days; P {\textless} .001). Limitations: The metropolitan areas sampled represented about one tenth of practicing dermatologists in the United States, and no remote or highly rural communities were included. Conclusions: Patients with a changing pigmented lesion, a possible indicator of malignancy, face wait-times just as long as those previously published for patients with routine complaints. Medicare patients did not experience any greater barriers to access. Although the use of physician extenders remains controversial, these practitioners were able to schedule patients more quickly than their supervising physicians. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.},

abstract = {The major objective of the present research is to examine the long-standing theoretical proposition that hostility and discriminatory attitudes toward out-groups are likely to rise with relative size of the out-group population. Using data from The German General Social Survey (ALLBUS, 1996) we provide, for the first time, an examination of the impact of both actual and perceived size of the foreign population on discriminatory attitudes toward foreigners. Specifically, by using a multiple-indicators analytical model, we examine the theoretical proposition that perceived threat posed by an out-group population mediates the relations between size of the out-group and exclusionary attitudes toward the out-group. The analysis does not support the theoretical expectation that actual size of the foreign population in the locale is likely to increase either perception of threat or exclusionary attitudes. Perceived size, however, is found to be associated, as expected, with perceived threat, and perceived threat is found to mediate the relations between perceived size and support for exclusionary practices against foreigners-the higher the perceived size, the more pronounced are both the threat and anti-foreigner attitudes. The findings and their significance are discussed in the light of sociological theories on the relations between minority size and discrimination. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The rationale for focusing on nonlinear models is that, if the dependent variable is binary or limited, or if the effect of the treatment varies with covariates, a nonlinear model is appropriate. In the spirit of Roehrig (Econometrica 56 (1988) 433), identification is attained nonparametrically and does not depend on the choice of the parametric specification for the response function of interest. One virtue of this approach is that it allows the researcher to construct estimators that can be interpreted as the parameters of a well-defined approximation to a treatment response function under functional form misspecification. In contrast to some usual IV models, heterogeneity of treatment effects is not restricted by the identification conditions. The ideas and estimators in this article are illustrated using IV to estimate the effects of 401(k) retirement programs on savings. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Given the difficulty of calculating the relationship between school quality and student outcomes, I turn to another method and use house prices to infer the value parents place on school quality. I look within school districts at houses located on attendance district boundaries; houses then differ only by the elementary school the child attends. I thereby effectively remove the variation in neighborhoods, taxes, and school spending. I find that parents are willing to pay 2.5 percent more fora5percent increase in test scores.

We expected that older workers transitioning into a new field would experience greater age discrimination than those who change jobs within the same field, particularly when amount of prior job experience is not made salient, and particularly when decision-makers were highly prejudiced. Results suggested that younger job applicants received higher suitability ratings than older job applicants, and job applicants making a within-career transition were rated higher than those making a between-career transition. As hypothesized, older job applicants making between-career transitions would receive the lowest ratings of suitability for hire when no information regarding experience was presented, and when decision-makers were highly prejudiced.

abstract = {The authors' review of the health services literature since the release of the landmark Report of the Secretary's Task Force Report of Black and Minority Health in 1985 revealed significant differences in access to medical care by race and ethnicity within certain disease categories and types of health services. The differences are not explained by such factors as socioeconomic status (SES), insurance coverage, stage or severity of disease, comorbidities, type and availability of health care services, and patient preferences. Under certain circumstances when important variables are controlled, racial and ethnic disparities in access are reduced and may disappear. Nonetheless, the literature shows that racial and ethnic disparities persist in significant measure for several disease categories and service types. The complex challenge facing current and future researchers is to understand the basis for such disparities and to determine why disparities are apparent in some but not other disease categories and service types.

@article{Gruber2014,
abstract = {Recent years have seen enormous growth in limited network plans that restrict patient choice of provider, particularly through state exchanges under the ACA. Opposition to such plans is based on concerns that restrictions on provider choice will harm patient care. We explore this issue in the context of the Massachusetts GIC, the insurance plan for state employees, which recently introduced a major financial incentive to choose limited network plans for one group of enrollees and not another. We use a quasi-experimental analysis based on the universe of claims data over a three-year period for GIC enrollees. We find that enrollees are very price sensitive in their decision to enroll in limited network plans, with the state's three month “premium holiday” for limited network plans leading 10{\%} of eligible employees to switch to such plans. We find that those who switched spent considerably less on medical care; spending fell by almost 40{\%} for the marginal complier. This reflects both reductions in quantity of services used and prices paid per service. But spending on primary care actually rose for switchers; the reduction in spending came entirely from spending on specialists and on hospital care, including emergency rooms. We find that distance traveled falls for primary care and rises for tertiary care, although there is no evidence of a decrease in the quality of hospitals used by patients. The basic results hold even for the sickest patients, suggesting that limited network plans are saving money by directing care towards primary care and away from downstream spending. We find such savings only for those whose primary care physicians are included in limited network plans, however, suggesting that networks that are particularly restrictive on primary care access may fare less well than those that impose only stronger downstream restrictions},

abstract = {Providing transparency into operational processes can change consumer and worker behavior. However, it is unclear whether operational transparency is beneficial inside a platform economy with potentially biased service providers. We explore this in the context of ridesharing platforms where early evidence documents bias similar to what has been observed in traditional transportation systems. Platforms responded by reducing operational transparency through removing information about riders' gender and race from the ride request presented to drivers. However, following this change, bias may still manifest through driver cancellation after a request is accepted, at which point the rider's picture is displayed. Our primary research question is to what extent a rider's gender, race, and perception of support for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights impact cancellation rates. We investigate this through a large field experiment on a major ridesharing platform in Washington, DC. By manipulating rider names and profile pictures, we observe drivers' behavior patterns in accepting and canceling rides. Our results confirm that bias at the ride request stage has been eliminated. However, after acceptance, racial and LGBT biases are persistent, while we find no evidence of gender biases. We also explore whether peak times moderate (through increased pay to drivers) or exacerbate (by signaling that there are many riders, allowing drivers to be more selective) these biases. We find a moderating effect of peak timing, with lower cancellation rates for non-caucasian riders. We do not find a similar moderating effect for riders that signal support for the LGBT community.},

Previous studies have focused either on the advantages of wikis or on concerns over the use of Wikipedia. In this study, we propose to use Wikipedia as a classroom wiki. In doing so, we discuss how students can improve their standard written assignments using Wikipedia instead of a module wiki. Compared to traditional essay assignments, students' submission of articles to Wikipedia can address many of the problems faced by instructors of traditional assignments, such as students' poor writing skills, lack of primary source research, and poorly balanced discussions. Our study was based on our experience in teaching an upper-level economics module at the National University of Singapore over two semesters: 121 students who were enrolled in semester 1 submitted a traditional writing assignment, while 124 students enrolled in semester 2 contributed two short entries to Wikipedia. The results showed a large increase in the number of students checking their assignment feedback. Further, students' writing quality improved noticeably in the Wikipedia assignment, and they were able to put forth more balanced discussions of relevant issues and include a greater number of primary sources. Despite the challenges faced when using Wiki markup language, the students enjoyed the overall experience.},

@article{Hausman2018,
abstract = {Recent empirical work in several economic fields, particularly environmental and energy economics, has adapted the regression discontinuity (RD) framework to applications where time is the running variable and treatment begins at a particular threshold in time. In this guide for practitioners, we discuss several features of this regression discontinuity in time framework that differ from the more standard cross-sectional RD framework. First, many applications (particularly in environmental economics) lack cross-sectional variation and are estimated using observations far from the temporal threshold. This common empirical practice is hard to square with the assumptions of a cross-sectional RD, which is conceptualized for an estimation bandwidth shrinking even as the sample size increases. Second, estimates may be biased if the time-series properties of the data are ignored (for instance, in the presence of an autoregressive process), or more generally if short-run and long-run effects differ. Finally, tests for sorting or bunching near the threshold are often irrelevant, making the framework closer to an event study than a regression discontinuity design. Based on these features and motivated by hypothetical examples using air quality data, we offer suggestions for the empirical researcher wishing to use the RD in time framework.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that widely used measures of antigay sentiment and the size of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) population are misestimated, likely substantially. In a series of online experiments using a large and diverse but nonrepresentative sample, we compare estimates from the standard methodology of asking sensitive questions to measures from a “veiled” methodology that precludes inference about an individual but provides population estimates. The veiled method increased self-reports of antigay sentiment, particularly in the workplace: respondents were 67{\%} more likely to disapprove of an openly gay manager when asked with a veil, and 71{\%} more likely to say it should be legal to discriminate in hiring on the basis of sexual orientation. The veiled methodology also produces larger estimates of the fraction of the population that identifies as LGBT or has had a sexual experience with a member of the same sex. Self-reports of nonheterosexual identity rose by 65{\%}, and same-sex sexual experiences by 59{\%}. We conduct a “placebo test” and show that for nonsensitive placebo items, the veiled methodology produces e ects that are small in magnitude and not significantly di erent from zero in seven out of eight items. Taken together, the results suggest antigay discrimination might be a more significant issue than formerly considered, as the nonheterosexual population and antigay workplace-related sentiment are both larger than previously measured.},

Firms create jobs where they locate, but there is frictional unemployment. Two sorts of agglomeration effects arise: those from economies of scale in matching, and those from production economies external to the firm. Regions may either be part of a unitary state in which case all regional policies are decided by the central government, or they may be part of a federal state in which case some policies are determined by the regional governments. We characterize the resource allocations in both a unitary and a federal state, and identify the set of instruments that are required to replicate the social optimum in each state.

abstract = {Tiebout choice among districts is the most powerful market force in American public education. Naive estimates of its effects are biased by endogenous district formation. The author derives instruments from the natural boundaries in a metropolitan area. The author's results suggest that metropolitan areas with greater Tiebout choice have more productive public schools and less private schooling. Little of the effect of Tiebout choice works through its effect on household sorting. This finding may be explained by another finding: students are equally segregated by school in metropolitan areas with greater and lesser degrees of Tiebout choice among districts.

abstract = {Thirty years after HIV was first identified, for the majority of those infected in the United States, effective combination therapies to combat HIV have turned the disease into a manageable chronic condition. But HIV discrimination has still proven intractable in the field of health care. For example, a series of studies has revealed that 46 percent of skilled nursing facilities, 55 percent of OB/GYNs, and 26 percent of plastic surgeons in Los Angeles County refuse to provide services to any HIV-positive patient, in violation of state and federal law. This Study examines HIV discrimination among dentists in Los Angeles County. For people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), dental care is particularly important because problems in the mouth may be the first symptoms of an HIV infection and can also signify disease progression; routine, proper dental care can have a significant impact on oral and general health. This Study reveals that 5 percent of dentists in Los Angeles County have a blanket policy of refusing to aaccept any HIV-positive patient, which is substantially lower than the finding for other health care providers. However, this Study also suggests that PLWHA who are poor and the most vulnerable, including women and people of color, face higher rates of discrimination. This Study goes on to explain that dentists can effectively and safely treat PLWHA, and it identifies why they are legally and ethically obligated to provide such care. After reviewing prior social science research on HIV discrimination by dentists, this Study presents its methodology and findings. Finally, it concludes by exploring potential reasons for why the documented discrimination rate is lower for dentists than it is for other health care providers in Los Angeles County, and it argues that future enforcement and education efforts should be targeted toward specific categories of dentists.},

By using data from a national contingent valuation survey, we estimate the aggregate benefits of meeting the goals of the Clean Water Act.

Several validation checks and tests for specific biases are performed, and the benefit estimates are corrected for missing and invalid responses. The two major policy implications from our work are that the benefits and costs of water pollution control efforts are roughly equal and that many of the new policy actions necessary to ensure that all water bodies reach at least a swimmable quality level will not have positive net benefits},

Here there is reason for optimism.

They explore the diversity of adaptations already at play in the labor market as older men and women seek to extend their working lives and finally, relate these findings in the U.S. to other OECD countries.},

abstract = {In the Regression Discontinuity (RD) design, units are assigned a treatment based on whether their value of an observed covariate is above or below a fixed cutoff. Under the assumption that the distribution of potential confounders changes continuously around the cutoff, the discontinuous jump in the probability of treatment assignment can be used to identify the treatment effect. Although a recent strand of the RD literature advocates interpreting this design as a local randomized experiment, the standard approach to estimation and inference is based solely on continuity assumptions that do not justify this interpretation. In this article, we provide precise conditions in a randomization inference context under which this interpretation is directly justified and develop exact finite-sample inference procedures based on them. Our randomization inference framework is motivated by the observation that only a few observations might be available close enough to the threshold where local randomization is plausible, and hence standard large-sample procedures may be suspect. Our proposed methodology is intended as a complement and a robustness check to standard RD inference approaches. We illustrate our framework with a study of two measures of party-level advantage in U.S. Senate elections, where the number of close races is small and our framework is well suited for the empirical analysis.},

The nature of today's retirement system left older households exposed to the collapse in the equity and housing markets and induced many to plan for a later retirement. More late-career workers experienced job loss than in previous recessions, often with long jobless spells, encouraging a record number of early Social Security retirement claims and disability applications. Going forward, workers who lost a job can expect lower earnings and more instability and, potentially, poorer health. Even households that avoided job loss will have less money available for spending in retirement due to low interest rates and reduced home values. These findings emphasize the importance of Social Security as income insurance and the need for a more robust retirement income system.},

abstract = {According to the minority stress model and social evaluation theory, stigma increases negative health outcomes in sexual minorities, and those with greater connection to a community appraise their lives with respect to fellow community members. This study was a secondary analysis of data from the online 2010 Social Justice Sexuality Project and examined associations between perceived homophobia, community connectedness, and having a health care provider among 2281 men who have sex with men (MSM). Approximately 37.9{\%} (n = 840) of the participants were African American/Black, and approximately 68.3{\%} (n = 1559) self-identified as gay. Perceived homophobia was associated with lower odds of having a regular health care provider (AOR = 0.89, 95{\%} CI 0.85–0.96). Income was associated with at least two-fold greater odds of having a regular health care provider, but only for incomes at or above {\$}20,000 (AORs 1.43–2.39, ps {\textless}.001). Community connectedness partially mediated and suppressed the negative association between perceived homophobia and having a primary care provider in the overall model (AOR = 0.95, 95{\%} CI 0.90–1.00), and mediated approximately 14.1{\%} of the total effect in the mediation model. Facilitating community connectedness for MSM may reduce the negative association between perceived homophobia and having a primary care provider, and community-based interventions that promote community connectedness may increase long-term engagement in healthcare utilization.},

Wage regressions have documented lower incomes for gays but repeatedly showed higher incomes for lesbians. The results concerning lesbian women are striking but can be reconciled with the existence of labor market discrimination, however. Problems like sample selection and unobserved heterogeneity-in particular, lesbians' violation of stereotypical female gender roles-might be responsible for their higher earnings.To investigate whether discrimination against lesbians actually does exist, a labor market experiment is conducted. Job applications of candidates, who are equivalent in their human capital but differ in their sexual orientation, are sent out in response to job advertisements. Furthermore, to test whether increased masculinity affects labor market outcomes, the applicants differ in their perceived gender identity.While results show a strong negative effect for lesbian orientation, gender identity does not have a significant overall impact on hiring chances. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Kalokerinos, von Hippel, and Zacher (2014) make a strong case encouraging greater research on stereotype threat in the workplace. Their arguments hinge on empirical evidence that the experience of stereotype threat is associated with employee outcomes such as unfavorable job attitudes, work disidentification, and lowered career aspirations. The agrees with Kalokerinos et al.'s conclusion: A stronger research emphasis on the stereotype threat construct will simultaneously lead to a greater understanding of how workplace conditions affect members of stereotyped groups and identify strategies for making workplaces more welcoming to those groups. She believe that their arguments will be effective in motivating researchers to study stereotype threat in the workplace. However, their arguments need to go further if we are going to convince managers about the value of stereotype threat research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

The researcher analyzed the impact on college attendance and completed schooling of the elimination of the Social Security Student Benefit Program in 1982. Under this program, the 18- to 22-year old children of deceased, disabled, or retired Social Security beneficiaries received monthly payments while enrolled full time in college from 1965 to 1982. In 1981, Congress voted to eliminate the program, which provides an opportunity to measure the incentive effects of financial aid. Using difference-in-differences methodology, and proxying for benefit eligibility with the death of a parent during an individual's childhood, the author finds that the elimination of the Social Security student benefit program reduced college attendance probabilities by more than a third. These estimates suggest that an offer of {\$}1,000 in grant aid increases the probability of attending college by about 3.6 percentage points. Aid eligibility also appears to increase completed schooling.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic. High morbidity and mortality rates of COVID-19 have been observed among older adults and widely reported in both mainstream and social media. The objective of this study was to analyze tweets related to COVID-19 and older adults, and to identify ageist content. DESIGN: We obtained a representative sample of original tweets containing the keywords “elderly,” “older,” and/or “boomer” plus the hashtags “{\#}COVID19” and/or “{\#}coronavirus.”. SETTING: Tweets posted between March 12 and March 21, 2020. MEASUREMENTS: We identified the type of user and number of followers for each account. Tweets were classified by three raters as (1) informative, (2) personal accounts, (3) personal opinions, (4) advice seeking, (5) jokes, and (6) miscellaneous. Potentially offensive content, as well as that downplaying the severity of COVID-19 because it mostly affects older adults, was identified. RESULTS: A total of 18,128 tweets were obtained, of which a random sample of 351 was analyzed. Most accounts (91.7{\%}) belonged to individuals. The most common types of tweets were personal opinions (31.9{\%}), followed by informative tweets (29.6{\%}), jokes/ridicule (14.3{\%}), and personal accounts (13.4{\%}). Overall, 72 tweets (21.9{\%}) likely intended to ridicule or offend someone and 21.1{\%} had content implying that the life of older adults was less valuable or downplayed the relevance of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Most tweets related to COVID-19 and older adults contained personal opinions, personal accounts, and jokes. Almost one-quarter of analyzed tweets had ageist or potentially offensive content toward older adults. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:1661-1665, 2020.},

abstract = {Recently, the regression discontinuity (RD) design has become increasingly popular among social scientists. One prominent application is the study of close elections. We explicate several methodological misunderstandings widespread across disciplines by revisiting the controversy concerning the validity of RD design when applied to close elections. Although many researchers invoke the local or as-if-random assumption near the threshold, it is more stringent than the required continuity assumption. We show that this seemingly subtle point determines the appropriateness of various statistical methods and changes our understanding of how sorting invalidates the design. When multiple-testing problems are also addressed, we find that evidence for sorting in US House elections is substantially weaker and highly dependent on estimation methods. Finally, we caution that despite the temptation to improve the external validity, the extrapolation of RD estimates away from the threshold sacrifices the design's advantage in internal validity.},

abstract = {Using Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) microdata over the 1980–2010 period, we provide new empirical evidence on the extent of and trends in the gender wage gap, which declined considerably during this time. By 2010, conventional human capital variables taken together explained little of the gender wage gap, while gender differences in occupation and industry continued to be important. Moreover, the gender pay gap declined much more slowly at the top of the wage distribution than at the middle or bottom and by 2010 was noticeably higher at the top. We then survey the literature to identify what has been learned about the explanations for the gap. We conclude that many of the traditional explanations continue to have salience. Although ­human-capital factors are now relatively unimportant in the aggregate, women's work force interruptions and shorter hours remain significant in high-skilled occupations, possibly due to compensating differentials. Gender differences in industries, as well as differences in gender roles and the gender division of labor remain important, and research based on experimental evidence strongly suggests that discrimination cannot be discounted. Psychological attributes or noncognitive skills comprise one of the newer explanations for gender differences in outcomes. Our effort to assess the quantitative evidence on the importance of these factors suggests that they account for a small to moderate portion of the gender pay gap, considerably smaller than, say, occupation and industry effects, though they appear to modestly contribute to these differences.

abstract = {The usage of social media is increasing exponentially since it has been the easiest and fastest way to share information between people or organizations. As a result of this broad usage and activity of people on social networks, considerable amount of data is generated continuously. The availability of user generated data makes it possible to analyze personality of people. Personality is the most distinctive feature for an individual. The results of these analyses can be utilized in several ways. They provide support for human resources recruitment units to consider suitable candidates. Similar products and services can be offered to people who share the similar personality characteristics. Personality traits help in diagnosis of certain mental illnesses. It is also helpful in forensics to use personality traits on suspects to clarify the forensic case. With the rapid dissemination of online documents in many different languages, the classification of these documents has become an important requirement. Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods have been used to classify these digitized data. In this study, current ML techniques and methodologies have been used to classify text documents and analyze person characteristics from these datasets. As a result of classification, detailed information about the personality traits of the writer could be obtained. It was seen that the frequency-based analysis and the use of the emotional words at the word level are crucial in the textual personality analysis.},

@article{Lage2000,
abstract = {Recent evidence has shown that a mismatch between an instructor's teaching style and a student's learning style can result in the student learning less and being less interested in the subject matter (Borg and Shapiro 1996; Ziegert forthcoming). This finding implies that either educational administrators should strive to ensure a good match between the instructor's teaching style and the students' learning styles (a difficult task) or that concerned instructors should use a portfolio of teaching styles so as to appeal to a variety of student learning types. Unfortunately, a majority of introductory economics courses are taught using only one teaching style-the traditional lecture format (Becker and Watts 1995). The ability of instructors to vary teaching styles in introductory economics courses is seemingly limited by time constraints. If an instructor wanted to lecture for those students who learn best via lecturing, conduct experiments for the experiential learners, give group assignments for the collaborative and cooperative learners, and oversee self-directed study for the independent learners, then he would need to increase student contact time fourfold. However, both the proliferation of students' access to multimedia and the advances in ease of multimedia development for faculty have created an environment where these layers of learning can be integrated without inordinately increasing contact time or sacrificing course coverage. We outline a strategy for teaching that appeals to a broad range of learning styles without violating the constraints typically faced by instructors at most institutions. In addition, we present student and faculty perceptions of such a course.},

In Norwegian municipal elections, potential left wing voters are likely to abstain from voting with election day rain, whereas the opposite holds for right-wingers. Then rainfall provides an exogenous source of variation, and hence an instrument, for the party composition of the municipal council. A strengthening of the right wing parties due to rainfall shifts expenditures toward education, but reduces total spending. This also shows that political competition does not drive party platforms to converge.},

We utilized 2005-2006, 2008-2009, and 2010-2011 data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Females had lower odds of depression diagnoses during and post-recession and better mental health during the recession, but higher odds of anxiety diagnoses post-recession. Males had lower odds of depression diagnoses and better mental health during and post-recession and lower Kessler 6 scores post-recession. We conducted stratified analyses, which confirmed that the aforementioned findings were consistent across the four different regions of the U.S., by employment status, income and health care utilization. Importantly, we found that the higher odds of anxiety diagnoses among females after the recession were mainly prominent among specific subgroups of females: those who lived in the Northeast or the Midwest, the unemployed, and those with low household income. Gender differences in mental health in association with the economic recession highlight the importance of policymakers taking these differences into consideration when designing economic and social policies to address economic downturns. Future research should examine the reasons behind the decreased depression diagnoses among both genders, and whether they signify decreased mental healthcare utilization or increased social support and more time for exercise and leisure activities.},

Findings indicate that 53{\%} (n = 34) of participants reported clinical levels of depression and 39{\%} (n = 25) reported clinical levels of anxiety. There was a direct relationship between social support and depression and anxiety, indicating that more social support is associated with less depression and anxiety when statistically excluding coping factors. In addition, more facilitative coping (e.g., seeking help) was related to less anxiety, whereas more avoidant coping (e.g., avoiding emotions) was related to more anxiety and depression. There was a significant interaction between social support and coping factors when predicting anxiety, such that individuals who reported higher social support used more facilitative coping which was associated with less anxiety and those who reported less social support used more avoidant coping which was associated with more anxiety. Clinical implications for working with genderqueer-identified clients are discussed.},

abstract = {Growing concerns about low awareness and take-up rates for government support programs like college financial aid have spurred calls to simplify the application process and enhance visibility. We present results from a randomized field experiment in which low-income individuals receiving tax preparation help were also offered immediate assistance and a streamlined process to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for themselves or their children. Treated participants were also provided with aid estimates that were compared against tuition cost amounts for nearby colleges. The combined assistance and information treatment substantially increased FAFSA submissions and ultimately the likelihood of college attendance, persistence, and aid receipt. In particular, high school seniors whose parents received the treatment were 8 percentage points more likely to have completed two years of college, going from 28{\%} to 36{\%}, during the first three years following the experiment. Families who received aid information but no assistance with the FAFSA did not experience improved outcomes. The findings suggest many other opportunities for using personal assistance to increase participation in programs that require filling out forms to become eligible. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.

Reanalysis of the 1972 and 1974 House and Senate campaign spending data using both OLS and 2SLS regression models shows that spending by challengers has a much greater impact on the outcome than does spending by incumbents. A similar analysis of the effects of spending on voters' recall of candidates int eh 1972 and 1974 SRC surveys supports the explanation that campaign expenditures buy nonimcumbents the necessary voter recognition already enjoyed by incumbents prior to the campaign. The 1974 survey questions on Senate candidates indicate that, although the inability to remember the candidates' names does not preclude having opinions about them, voters recalling candidates are much more likely to offer evaluative comments, and these more frequently refere to candidates personally. Aware voters offer more negative as well as positive evaluations (though positive outnumber negative); familiarity is not automaticallly advantageous. And voters' evaluations of candidates strongly influence how they vote. The implications of these findings for congressional campaign finance policy are readily apparent.},

The evidence suggest that the average ranking, winning rate and awarded prize did not differ by gender nor between teachers in competition groups with only female teachers or with both genders. I also find that the direct impact of the bonus program on students' outcomes did not vary by male and female teachers or by the type of competitive environment in terms of gender mix of the participants. As for mechanisms that can explain these results, I found no differences by either gender or by the gender mix of the competition group in teachers' awareness and familiarity with the program and its rules, and in effort and teaching methods. Women though were more pessimistic about the effectiveness of teachers' performance pay and more realistic than men about their likelihood of winning bonuses.},

Its contribution is twofold, with a broadening of the existing research regarding rural workers, and its new evidence of the structure of wages faced by American Indians. The results show that with the rural focus, American Indian males and Black females experience the weakest wage returns to education within their respective genders. However, merely examining employment and wage rates, American Indians and Blacks of both genders face an economic disadvantage relative to Whites. Examining wage gaps, gender differences are more striking. Females face smaller actual majority/minority wage gaps, but more of the gap remains unexplained by personal and job characteristics. In other words, male wage gaps are driven more by differences in characteristics, while female wage gaps are driven more by differences in returns. This implies that discrimination is more prevalent in the rural female labor market, although its actual effect on wages is smaller.

abstract = {Most papers that employ Differences-in-Differences estimation (DD) use many years of data and focus on serially correlated outcomes but ignore that the resulting standard errors are inconsistent. To illustrate the severity of this issue, we randomly generate placebo laws in state-level data on female wages from the Current Population Survey. For each law, we use OLS to compute the DD estimate of its “effect” as well as the standard error of this estimate. These conventional DD standard errors severely understate the standard deviation of the estimators: we find an “effect” significant at the 5 percent level for up to 45 percent of the placebo interventions. We use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate how well existing methods help solve this problem. Econometric corrections that place a specific parametric form on the time-series process do not perform well. Bootstrap (taking into account the autocorrelation of the data) works well when the number of states is large enough. Two corrections based on asymptotic approximation of the variance-covariance matrix work well for moderate numbers of states and one correction that collapses the time series information into a “pre”- and “post”-period and explicitly takes into account the effective sample size works well even for small numbers of states.},

What part of the ‘ethnic penalty' in the labour market is due to recruitment discrimination? This experiment, the first of its kind in Ireland, explicitly measured this by sending out nearly 500 equivalent CVs from Irish and minority candidates in response to advertised vacancies in the greater Dublin area. We find that candidates with Irish names are over twice as likely to be called to interview as are candidates with an African, Asian or German name. This discrimination rate is high by international standards, and does not vary between minority groups. We develop the discussion of the role of prejudice and stereotypes in discrimination in this article, arguing that our findings may be linked to the fact that Ireland is a ‘new immigration' country, with no established minority groups and a cohesive national identity.

abstract = {This study investigates change over time in the level of hiring discrimination in US labor markets. We perform a meta-analysis of every available field experiment of hiring discrimination against African Americans or Latinos (n = 28). Together, these studies represent 55,842 applications submitted for 26,326 positions. We focus on trends since 1989 (n = 24 studies), when field experiments became more common and improved methodologically. Since 1989, whites receive on average 36{\%} more callbacks than African Americans, and 24{\%} more callbacks than Latinos. We observe no change in the level of hiring discrimination against African Americans over the past 25 years, although we find modest evidence of a decline in discrimination against Latinos. Accounting for applicant education, applicant gender, study method, occupational groups, and local labor market conditions does little to alter this result. Contrary to claims of declining discrimination in American society, our estimates suggest that levels of discrimination remain largely unchanged, at least at the point of hire.},

abstract = {Only a minority of American households feels “confident” about retirement saving adequacy, and little is known about why people fail to plan for retirement, and whether planning and information costs might affect retirement saving patterns. To better understand these issues, we devised and fielded a purpose-built module on planning and financial literacy for the 2004 Health and Retirement Study (HRS). This module measures how workers make their saving decisions, how they collect the information for making these decisions, and whether they possess the financial literacy needed to make these decisions. Our analysis shows that financial illiteracy is widespread among older Americans: only half of the age 50+ respondents could correctly answer two simple questions regarding interest compounding and inflation, and only one-third correctly answered these two questions and a question about risk diversification. Women, minorities, and those without a college degree were particularly at risk of displaying low financial knowledge. We also evaluate whether people tried to figure out how much they need to save for retirement, whether they devised a plan, and whether they succeeded at the plan. In fact, these calculations prove to be difficult: fewer than one-third of our age 50+ respondents ever tried to devise a retirement plan, and only two-thirds of those who tried actually claim to have succeeded. Overall, fewer than one-fifth of the respondents believed they engaged in successful retirement planning. We also find that financial knowledge and planning are clearly interrelated: those who displayed financial knowledge were more likely to plan and to succeed in their planning. Moreover, those who did plan were more likely to rely on formal methods such as retirement calculators, retirement seminars, and financial experts, and less likely to rely on family/relatives or co-workers.},

Specifically, campaign effects were strongest for candidates running for the opposition parties, especially those who ran non-winning campaigns. Our results suggest that the local party organizations of non-winning candidates are in the position of being able to realize potentially significant electoral returns through the mobilization of additional personnel or financial resources in their constituency campaigns.},

We adopt the Timing of Events approach to identify this dynamic treatment effect using monthly calendar data from a representative sample of Flemish (Belgian) youth who started searching for a job right after leaving formal education. We find that overeducation is a trap. By accepting a job for which one is overeducated rather than only accepting adequate job matches, monthly transition rates into adequate employment fall by 51-98{\%}, depending on the elapsed unemployment duration. These findings challenge the career mobility thesis and imply that the short-term benefits of policies that generate quick transitions into employment must be traded-off against the long-term costs of an inadequate job match. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Accordingly, CBT has been formally recognized as an empirically supported treatment for anxiety-related conditions. This article reviews the evidence supporting the efficacy of CBT for anxiety disorders. Specifically, contemporary meta-analytic studies on the treatment of anxiety disorders are reviewed and the efficacy of CBT is examined. Although the specific components of CBT differ depending on the study design and the anxiety disorder treated, meta-analyses suggest that CBT procedures (particularly exposure-based approaches) are highly efficacious. CBT generally outperforms wait-list and placebo controls. Thus, CBT provides incremental efficacy above and beyond nonspecific factors. For some anxiety disorders, CBT also tends to outperform other psychosocial treatment modalities. The implications of available meta-analytic findings in further delineating the efficacy and dissemination of CBT for anxiety disorders are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

State-by-state variation in labor market tightness is used to find that people with disabilities may have especially procyclical employment, but the contrary results in overall employment trends remain after accounting for labor market tightness.

abstract = {Does emergency financial assistance reduce criminal behavior among those experiencing negative shocks? To address this question, we exploit quasi-random variation in the allocation of temporary financial assistance to eligible individuals and families that have experienced an economic shock. Chicago's Homelessness Prevention Call Center (HPCC) connects such families and individuals with assistance, but the availability of funding varies unpredictably. Consequently, we can determine the impact of temporary assistance on crime by comparing outcomes for those who call when funds are available to those who call when no funds are available. Linking this call center information to arrest records from the Chicago Police Department, we find some evidence that total arrests fall between 1 and 2 years after the call. For violent crime, police arrest those for whom funds were available 51{\%} less often than those who were eligible but for whom no funds were available. Single individuals drive this decrease. The decline in crime appears to be related, in part, to greater housing stability—being referred to assistance significantly decreases arrests for homelessness-related, outdoor crimes such as trespassing. However, we also find that financial assistance leads to an increase in property crime arrests. This increase is evident for family heads, but not single individuals; the increase is mostly due to shoplifting; and the timing of this increase suggests that financial assistance enables some families to take on financial obligations that they are subsequently unable to meet. Overall, the change in the mix of crime induced by financial assistance generates considerable social benefits due to the greater social cost of violence.},

Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore the role that culture, particularly acculturation to Canadian aboriginal heritage culture, may play in emerging adulthood. Specifically, aboriginal emerging adults who scored above or below the mean of their peers on acculturation to their heritage (aboriginal) culture were compared to their majority European Canadian counterparts in several aspects of emerging adulthood including (a) perceived adult status, (b) perceived criteria for adulthood, (c) achieved criteria for adulthood, (d) personal beliefs about the future, and (e) risk behaviours. Results revealed the significance of examining acculturation in understanding the role of culture in the process of emerging adulthood, particularly among ethnic minority youth. In particular, findings revealed that young aboriginal adults' level of identification with aboriginal traditions such as the significance of interdependence and maintenance of harmony, the role of children and family, and historical sociocultural events appeared to play a role in many aspects of emerging adulthood.},

abstract = {Natural resource damage assessment under var- ious federal and state laws has given research in non-market valuation high visibility. This paper is about a consistency check suggested by the recent NOAA Blue Ribbon panel as one basis for evaluating contingent valuation (CV) sur- veys. This check relates to the responsiveness of valuation estimates to changes in the scope or size in an environmental commodity. Critics of the CV method have recently argued, on the basis of several empirical studies, that the CV method is incapable of demonstrating scope and is therefore too unreliable to obtain useful in- formation for natural resource damage assess- ments.' In this paper we question their conclu- sion on the basis of some evidence from the larger CV literature and a reanalysis of the studies con- ducted by the critics. While the issues of scope and sequence are often confounded under the ill- defined rubric of embedding, due to space con- siderations, we confine our remarks in this pa- per solely to the issue of scope.},

Analyses of expenditures and voting are often plagued by simultaneity between campaign spending and expected vote share. However, game-theoretic models of resource-allocation decisions made by a central actor (i.e., a presidential campaign) suggest that candidates will spend more in close races and in races likely to be pivotal. We provide empirical support for this theory; using Federal Communications Commission data from the 1972 presidential election, we find that expenditures were higher in states where the election was expected to be closer and in states likely to be pivotal. We use these two factors as instruments in a two-stage least squares model to estimate the effect of spending on votes. We find that, contrary to previous theory and research, presidential campaign spending significantly increases a candidate's vote share.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Minority physicians are more likely than their counterparts to work in underserved communities and care for minority, poor, and uninsured patients, but much of this research has examined primary care physicians alone. Few have investigated whether non-primary care specialists of minority backgrounds are more likely to serve the underserved than nonminority specialists. OBJECTIVE We examined whether underrepresented minority (URM) physicians from a wide variety of specialties are more likely than non-URM physicians to practice in underserved communities. METHODS Using California Medical Board Physician Licensure Survey (2007) data for 48388 physicians, we geo-coded practice zip codes to medically underserved areas (MUAs) and primary care health professional shortage areas (HPSAs). Logistic regression models adjusting for age, gender, specialty, and other characteristics were used to explore associations with race, ethnicity, specialty, and designated underserved areas. RESULTS We found that African American, Latino, and Pacific Islanders were more likely to work in MUAs and HPSAs than were white physicians (adjusted odds ratio, 1.22-2.25; p {\textless} .05). Similar patterns of practice in MUAs and HPSAs by physician race and ethnicity were found when performing the analyses separately among primary care physicians and physicians in non-primary care specialties. CONCLUSION In summary, our study underscores the importance of underrepresented minority physicians in all specialties for the physician workforce needs of disadvantaged communities. To improve health care for underserved communities, continued efforts to increase physician diversity are essential.},

A large literature in econometrics has developed procedures for detecting weak instruments and constructing robust confidence sets, but many of the results in this literature are limited to settings with independent and homoskedastic data, while data encountered in practice frequently violate these assumptions. We review the literature on weak instruments in linear IV regression with an emphasis on results for nonhomoskedastic (heteroskedastic, serially correlated, or clustered) data. To assess the practical importance of weak instruments, we also report tabulations and simulations based on a survey of papers published in the American Economic Review from 2014 to 2018 that use IV. These results suggest that weak instruments remain an important issue for empirical practice, and that there are simple steps that researchers can take to better handle weak instruments in applications.},

Second, we replicate this result using data from the United States and the United Kingdom. Third, we note a strikingly strong within-family relationship between body size and cognitive skills/noncognitive skills. Fourth, a large part of the estimated body-size penalty reflects lower skill acquisition among overweight and obese teenagers.

Drawing from social-identity and social- categorization theory, we theoretically argue that, in age-diverse companies, age-based subgrouping processes occur, favouring a shared perception of a negative age-discrimination climate. This perceived negative age-discrimination climate in turn negatively relates to organizational performance. As the main contribution, top managers' negative age-related stereotypes and diversity-friendly HR policies are introduced as organizational-level moderators that increase and attenuate, respectively, the social categorization processes affecting performance in age-diverse companies. We utilized structural equation modelling (SEM) to test the proposed hypotheses using a multisource dataset comprising 147 companies. The results supported all hypotheses, indicating that low negative top managers' age stereotypes as well as high diversity-friendly HR policies are potential organizational factors that can prevent the negative relation of age diversity with organizational performance transmitted through the negative age-discrimination climate. These results are discussed in light of their contribution to the diversity literature and social-categorization theory as well as their implication for practitioners.},

Using data from 50 states between 1999 and 2008, we employ a two-way fixed effects panel data framework and a dynamic system GMM approach to account for the dynamic features of employment outcomes. We also correct for potential measurement errors and potential endogeneity of policy variables. Our results suggest that state business incentives such as providing more foreign-trade zones (both general-purpose and subzones), the provision of better public services and establishing overseas offices in particular countries, have statistically significant effects on employment by foreign-owned firms in the US.

To do so, we designed a correspondence experiment to be conducted in schools. We created three types of fictitious couples-one heterosexual, one gay, and one lesbian-and sent emails to schools in which the couples' sexual orientation was explicit. Our results show that gay couples had a significantly lower (22 percentage points) call-back probability than heterosexual couples. No statistically significant differences in call-back probability were found between the lesbian and heterosexual couples.},

abstract = {Labor force composition and the allocation of talent remain of vital import to modern economies. For their part, governments and companies around the globe have implemented equal employment opportunity (EEO) regulations to influence labor market flows. Even though such regulations are pervasive, surprisingly little is known about their impacts. We use a natural field experiment conducted across 10 U.S. cities to investigate if EEO statements in job advertisements affect the first step in the employment process, application rates. Making use of data from nearly 2,500 job seekers, we find considerable policy effects, but in an unexpected direction: the presence of an EEO statement dampens rather than encourages racial minorities' willingness to apply for jobs. Importantly, the effects are particularly pronounced for educated job seekers and in cities with white majority populations. Complementary survey evidence suggests the underlying mechanism at work is “tokenism”, revealing that EEO statements backfire because racial minorities avoid environments in which they are perceived as regulatory, or symbolic, hires rather than being hired on their own merits. Beyond their practical and theoretical importance, our results highlight how field experiments can significantly improve policymaking. In this case, if one goal of EEO regulations is to enhance the pool of minority applicants, then it is not working.},

abstract = {This article uses computational text analysis to study the form and content of more than 3000 recommendation letters submitted on behalf of applicants to a major U.S. anesthesiology residency program. The article finds small differences in form and larger differences in content. Women applicants' letters were more likely to contain references to acts of service, for example, whereas men were more likely to be described in terms of their professionalism and technical skills. Some differences persisted when controlling for standardized aptitude test scores, on which women and men scored equally on average, and other applicant and letter-writer characteristics. Even when all explicit gender-identifying language was stripped from the letters, a machine learning algorithm was able to predict applicant gender at a rate better than chance. Gender stereotyped language in recommendation letters may infect the entirety of an employer's hiring or selection process, implicating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Not all gendered language differences were large, however, suggesting that small changes may remedy the problem. The article closes by proposing a computationally driven system that may help employers identify and eradicate bias, while also prompting a rethinking of our gendered, racialized, ableist, ageist, and otherwise stereotyped occupational archetypes.},

abstract = {The researchers explored personal and contextual factors that inhibit or facilitate the use of older worker stereotypes in a selection context. The authors suggest that older worker stereotypes are more likely to be used and influence applicant evaluations when raters are biased against older workers, when raters do not have the cognitive resources to inhibit the use of age-associated stereotypes, or when applicants apply for age-incongruent jobs. The researchers explored the extent to which raters differing in older worker bias make discriminatory decisions about young or old individuals applying for age-typed jobs under conditions of high- and low-cognitive demands. A laboratory study was conducted with 131 undergraduate students who evaluated applicants in a simulated employment context. Results indicated that older worker bias, cognitive busyness, and job age-type interact to affect the extent to which applicant age plays a role in selection decisions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Objectives. We examined associations of race/ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation with mental disorders among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youths. Methods. We assessed mental disorders by administering a structured di- agnostic interview to a community sample of 246 LGBT youths aged 16 to 20 years. Participants also completed the Brief Symptom Inventory 18 (BSI 18). Results. One third of participants met criteria for any mental disorder, 17{\%} for conduct disorder, 15{\%} for major depression, and 9{\%} for posttraumatic stress disorder. Anorexia and bulimia were rare. Lifetime suicide attempts were frequent (31{\%}) but less so in the prior 12 months (7{\%}). Few racial/ethnic and gender differences were statistically significant. Bisexually identified youths had lower prevalences of every diagnosis. The BSI 18 had high negative predictive power (90{\%}) and low positive predictive power (25{\%}) for major depression. Conclusions. LGBT youths had higher prevalences of mental disorder di- agnoses than youths in national samples, but were similar to representative samples of urban, racial/ethnic minority youths. Suicide behaviors were similar to those among representative youth samples in the same geographic area. Questionnaires measuring psychological distress may overestimate depression prevalence among this population.},

METHODS: Two hundred ten PCPs and 190 CMs from 3 health care organizations in the Denver, Colorado, metropolitan area completed Implicit Association Tests and self-report measures of implicit and explicit bias, respectively. RESULTS: With a 60{\%} participation rate, the PCPs demonstrated substantial implicit bias against both Latinos and African Americans, but this was no different from CMs. Explicit bias was largely absent in both groups. Adjustment for background characteristics showed the PCPs had slightly weaker ethnic/racial bias than CMs. CONCLUSIONS: This research provided the first evidence of implicit bias against Latinos in health care, as well as confirming previous findings of implicit bias against African Americans. Lack of substantive differences in bias between the experienced PCPs and CMs suggested a wider societal problem. At the same time, the wide range of implicit bias suggested that bias in health care is neither uniform nor inevitable, and important lessons might be learned from providers who do not exhibit bias.},

There appears to be a perception that such methods are theoretically justified, even though they can lead to evidently nonsensical results. We argue that controlling for global high-order polynomials in regression discontinuity analysis is a flawed approach with three major problems: it leads to noisy estimates, sensitivity to the degree of the polynomial, and poor coverage of confidence intervals. We recommend researchers instead use estimators based on local linear or quadratic polynomials or other smooth functions.},

Our assessment uses data on outcome and pretest measures from six educational experiments, ranging from preschool through high school, to estimate RDD generalization bias. We then compare those estimates (reported as standardized effect sizes) with the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) standard for acceptable bias size (≤ 0.05$\sigma$) for two target populations, one spanning a half–standard deviation pretest-score range and another spanning a full–standard deviation pretest-score range. Our results meet this standard for all 18 study/outcome/pretest scenarios examined given the narrower target population, and for 15 scenarios given the broader target population. Fortunately, two of the three exceptions represent pronounced “ceiling effects” that can be identified empirically, making it possible to avoid unwarranted RDD generalizations, and the third exception is very close to the WWC standard.},

abstract = {During the Great Recession, more older workers have claimed Social Security retirement benefits early.  This paper addresses two important policy questions: Who are these early claimers?  How much retirement income have they lost as a result of claiming early?  Using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) we estimate a discrete-time hazard model that makes claiming Social Security benefits a function of age, personal characteristics, and the national unemployment rate.  We project that high unemployment rates during the Great Recession led to a 5-percentage-point increase in the probability of claiming early relative to less severe recessions such as the 2001-2003 downturn, and this increase was nearly uniform across socioeconomic groups.  Our estimates also suggest that while the Great Recession did impact the claiming decision, it did not cause a dramatic change in monthly benefits.  Those individuals we label as “Great Recession Claimers” – whom we simulate were likely to claim their benefits early during the Great Recession but would not have claimed them in a milder downturn – filed for Social Security only 6 months earlier, on average, than they would have in a minor recession.  This modest change in timing reduced their monthly Social Security benefit checks by {\$}56, or 4.6 percent of average monthly benefits, and the Social Security replacement rate fell by 1.7 percentage points relative to a more typical recession.  The benefit reduction resulted from the combined effect of the actuarial reduction for early claiming and the foregone opportunity to continue working and increase the wage base used for calculating benefits.},

This article compares two of America's leading technology regions—California's Silicon Valley and Massachusetts' Route 128, to suggest the limits of the notion of external economies and to propose an alternative network approach to analyzing regional economies. By rejecting the sharp distinction between what occurs inside and outside the firm, the network approach illuminates the complex and historically evolved relations between firms and the social structures and institutions of a par- ticular locality. Through a set of comparisons of companies in Silicon Valley and Route 128, the article explains the divergent performance of these two apparently comparable regional clusters, and in so doing provides insights into the local sources of competitive advantage.},

abstract = {We evaluate the effects of state-provided financial incentives for biotech companies, which are part of a growing trend of placed-based policies designed to spur innovation clusters. We estimate that the adoption of subsidies for biotech employers by a state raises the number of star biotech scientists in that state by about 15{\%} over a three year period. A 10{\%} decline in the user cost of capital induced by an increase in R{\&}D tax incentives raises the number of stars by 22{\%}. Most of the gains are due to the relocation of star scientist to adopting states, with limited effect on the productivity of. incumbent scientists already in the state. The gains are concentrated among private sector inventors. We uncover little effect. of subsidies on academic researchers, consistent with the fact that their incentives are unaffected. Our estimates indicate that the effect on overall employment in the biotech sector is of comparable magnitude to that on star scientists. Consistent with a model where workers are fairly mobile across states, we find limited effects on salaries in the industry. We uncover large effects on employment in the non-traded sector due to a sizable multiplier effect, with the largest impact on employment in construction and retail. Finally, we find mixed evidence of a displacement effect on states that are geographically close, or states that economically close as measured by migration flows. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Hypotheses are tested using data on firms which have moved from Milwaukee City to its suburbs between 1964 and 1974. The industries considered are: construction; manufacturing; transportation, communications, and public utilities; wholesale trade; retail trade; finance, insurance and real estate; and services. While this problem has been examined for manufacturing with limited success, the results here are encouraging. The results show that agglomeration economies and an available labor force are important influences in the site choice among suburban locations for firms in all industries. Fiscal variables are at best only of secondary significance in the choice among suburban municipalities.},

abstract = {Transgender and gender nonconforming people face stigma and discrimination from a wide variety of sources and through numerous social realms. Stigma and discrimination originating from biomedicine and health care provision may impact this group's access to primary care. Such stigma and discrimination may originate not only from direct events and past negative experiences, but also through medicine's role in providing treatments of transitioning, the development of formal diagnoses to provide access to such treatments, and the medical language used to describe this diverse group. This paper examines the postponement of primary curative care among this marginalized group of people by drawing from the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, one of the largest available datasets for this underserved group. This paper also proposes an innovate categorization system to account for differences in self-conceptualization and identity, which has been of considerable concern for transgender and gender nonconforming communities but remains underexplored in social and health research. Results suggest that experience, identity, state of transition, and disclosure of transgender or gender nonconforming status are associated with postponement due to discrimination. Other findings suggest that postponement associated with primary place of seeking care and health insurance has ties to both discrimination and affordability. These findings highlight the importance of combating stigma and discrimination generated from within or experienced at sites of biomedicine or health care provision in improving access to care for this group of people. Improving access to care for all gender variant people requires a critical evaluation of existing research practices and health care provision to ensure that care is tailored as needed to each person's perspective in relation to larger social processes. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The synthetic control (SC) method has been recently proposed as an alternative to estimate treatment effects in comparative case studies. In this paper, we revisit the SC method in a linear factor model setting and consider the asymptotic properties of the SC estimator when the number of pre-treatment periods (T0) goes to infinity. Differently from Abadie et al. (2010), we do not condition the analysis on a close-to- perfect pre-treatment fit, as the probability that this happens goes to zero when T0 is large. We show that, even when a close-to-perfect fit is not achieved, the SC method can substantially improve relative to the difference-in-differences (DID) estimator, both in terms of bias and variance. However, we show that, in our setting, the SC estimator is asymptotically biased if treatment assignment is correlated with the unobserved heterogeneity. If common factors are stationary, then the asymptotic bias of the SC estimator goes to zero when the variance of the transitory shocks is small, which is also the case in which it is more likely that the pre-treatment fit will be good. If a subset of the common factors is non-stationary, then the SC estimator can be asymptotically biased even conditional on a close-to-perfect fit. In this case, the identification assumption relies on orthogonality between treatment assignment and the stationary common factors. Finally, we also consider the statistical properties of the permutation tests suggested in Abadie et al. (2010).},

abstract = {BackgroundPrior investigations have suggested that physician-related factors may contribute to differential use of TKA among women and ethnic minorities. We sought to evaluate the effect of surgeon bias on recommendations for TKA. Questions/purposeUsing an experimental approach with standardized patient scenarios, we sought to evaluate surgeon recommendations regarding TKA, specifically to determine whether recommendations for TKA are influenced by (1) patient race, and (2) patient sex. MethodsWe developed four computerized scenarios for all combinations of race (white or black) and sex (male or female) for otherwise similar patients with end-stage knee osteoarthritis. Patients gave an orthopaedic history of 2 years worsening pain with decreased functional status and failure of oral antiinflammatory medications and corticosteroid intraarticular injections. Orthopaedic surgeons attending the 2012 annual meetings of the New York State Society of Orthopaedic Surgeons and American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons were recruited for the study. Surgeons passing an open recruitment table at each meeting were asked to participate. Of the 1111 surgeons in attendance at either meeting, 113 (10.2{\%}) participated in the study. All participants viewed the “control” patient's story (white male) and were randomized to view one of the three “experimental” scenarios (white female, black male, black female). After viewing each scenario, the participants were anonymously asked whether they would recommend TKA. An a priori power analysis showed that 112 participants were needed to detect a 15{\%} difference in the likelihood of recommending surgery for white versus nonwhite patients in the test scenarios evaluated with 90{\%} power at a level of significance of 0.05. ResultsOf the 39 surgeons who viewed the white male plus black female scenario, there were 33 (85{\%}) concordant responses (TKA offered to both patients) and six discordant responses (TKA offered to only one of the patients), with no effect of patient race and sex (p = 0.99). Of the 37 surgeons who viewed the white male plus black male scenario, there were 33 (89{\%}) concordant responses and four discordant responses, with no effect of patient race (p = 0.32). Of the 37 surgeons who viewed the white male plus white female scenario, there were 30 (77{\%}) concordant responses and seven discordant responses, with no effect of patient sex (p = 0.71). ConclusionAfter orthopaedic surgeons viewed video scenarios of patients with end-stage knee osteoarthritis, patient race and sex were not associated with a different likelihood of a surgical recommendation. Our findings support the notion that patient race and sex may be less influential on decision making when there are strong clinical data to support a decision. Physician bias may have a greater effect on decision making in situations where the indications for surgery are less clear.},

Specifically, in an online survey of 173 trainees and professionals in mental health, this study used 3 measures related to cultural sensitivity as predictors of therapists' expectancies for bond and prognosis with African American clients compared with White clients. The Multicultural Counseling Inventory (MCI; Sodowsky, Taffe, Gutkin, {\&} Wise, 1994) was used to measure global multicultural competence. The Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, {\&} Schwartz, 1998) served as a measure of automatic prejudice toward Blacks. Additionally, a new self-report measure of anti-Black clinical prejudice was created specifically for this study. The Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (Paulhus, 1984) was included to control for socially desirable responding. Each predictor of cultural sensitivity uniquely explained variance in anti-Black bias in bond ratings, with the IAT accounting for more variance than the 2 self-reports. Our novel measure of clinical prejudice accounted for anti-Black bias in prognosis ratings, but the MCI and the IAT did not. Researchers studying cultural competence are encouraged to consider the roles of automatic and deliberate prejudice in determining disparities in clinical expectancies and cross-racial therapeutic alliances. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Psychological Association.},

Drawing on the Stereotype Content Model, we content analysed newspaper coverage and corporate media of 50 large-scale Dutch organisations, published between 2006 and 2013. The data revealed that stereotypical portrayals of older employees are more common in news media than in corporate media and mixed in terms of valence. Specifically, older employees were positively portrayed with regard to warmth stereotypes, such as trustworthiness, but negatively with regard to competence stereotypes, such as technological competence and adaptability. Additionally, stereotypical portrayals that do not clearly belong to warmth or competence dimensions are found, such as the mentoring role stereotype and the costly stereotype. Because competence stereotypes weigh more heavily in employers' productivity perceptions, these media portrayals might contribute to the employability problem of older employees. We suggest that older employees could benefit from a more realistic media debate about their skills and capacities.},

abstract = {Study objective: We previously reported that Hispanic ethnicity was an independent risk factor for inadequate analgesic administration among patients presenting to a single emergency department. We then attempted to generalize these findings to other ethnic groups and EDs. Our current study objective is to determine whether black patients with extremity fractures are less likely to receive ED analgesics than similarly injured white patients. Methods: We conducted the following retrospective cohort study at an urban ED in Atlanta, GA. All black and white patients presenting with new, isolated long-bone fractures over a 40-month period were studied. After abstracting demographic information from the medical record and subsequently removing ethnic identifiers, we submitted the medical record to a physician who recorded characteristics of the patients' injury and treatment. We then submitted the records to a nurse, again blinded to ethnicity, who recorded analgesic administration. We used multiple logistic regression to determine the independent effect of ethnicity on analgesic use while controlling for multiple potential confounders. Our main outcome measure was the proportion of black versus white patients receiving ED analgesics. Results: The study group consisted of 217 patients, of whom 127 were black and 90 were white. White patients were significantly more likely than black patients to receive ED analgesics (74{\%} versus 57{\%}, P=.01) despite similar records of pain complaints in the medical record. The risk of receiving no analgesic while in the ED was 66{\%} greater for black patients than for white patients (relative risk 1.66, 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.11 to 2.50). This effect persisted after controlling for multiple potential confounders. Conclusion: Black patients with isolated long-bone fractures were less likely than white patients to receive analgesics in this ED. No covariate measured in this study could account for this effect. Our findings have implications for efforts to improve analgesic practices for all patients.},

abstract = {There are two fundamentally different views of the role of elections in policy formation. In one view, voters can affect candidates' policy choices: competition for votes induces politicians to move toward the center. In this view, elections have the effect of bringing about some degree of policy compromise. In the alternative view, voters merely elect policies: politicians cannot make credible promises to moderate their policies, and elections are merely a means to decide which one of two opposing policy views will be implemented. We assess which of these contrasting perspectives is more empirically relevant for the U. S. House. Focusing on elections decided by a narrow margin allows us to generate quasi-experimental estimates of the impact of a "randomized" change in electoral strength on subsequent representatives' roll-call voting records. We find that voters merely elect policies: the degree of electoral strength has no effect on a legislator's voting behavior. For example, a large exogenous increase in electoral strength for the Democratic party in a district does not result in shifting both parties' nominees to the left. Politicians' inability to credibly commit to a compromise appears to dominate any competition-induced convergence in policy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

A common government strategy to deter discrimination is to publicize the law and communicate potential penalties for violations. We study this strategy by coupling an audit experiment with a randomized intervention involving nearly 700 landlords in New York City and report the first causal estimates of the effect on rental discrimination against blacks and Hispanics of a targeted government messaging campaign. We uncover discrimination levels higher than prior estimates indicate, especially against Hispanics, who are approximately 6 percentage points less likely to receive callbacks and offers than whites. We find suggestive evidence that government messaging can reduce discrimination against Hispanics but not against blacks. The findings confirm discrimination's persistence and suggest that government messaging can address it in some settings, but more work is needed to understand the conditions under which such appeals are most effective.},

abstract = {This paper provides early evidence of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on minority unemployment in the United States. In the first month following March adoptions of social distancing measures by states, unemployment rose to 14.5{\%} but a much higher 24.4{\%} when we correct for potential data misclassification noted by the BLS. Using the official definition, unemployment in April 2020 among African-Americans rose by less than what would have been anticipated (to 16.6{\%}) based on previous recessions, and the long-term ordering of unemployment across racial/ethnic groups was altered with Latinx unemployment (18.2{\%}) rising for the first time to the highest among major groups. Difference-in-difference estimates confirm that the initial gap in unemployment between whites and blacks in April was not different than in periods prior to the pandemic; however, the racial gap expanded as unemployment for whites declined in the next two months but was largely stagnant for blacks. The initially large gap in unemployment between whites and Latinx in April was sustained in May and June as unemployment declined similarly for both groups. Non-linear decompositions show a favorable industry distribution partly protected black employment during the early stages of the pandemic, but that an unfavorable occupational distribution and lower average skills levels placed them at higher risk of job losses. An unfavorable occupational distribution and lower skills contributed to a sharply widened Latinx-white unemployment gap that moderated over time as rehiring occurred. These findings of disproportionate impacts on minority unemployment raise important concerns regarding lost earnings and wealth, and longer-term consequences of the pandemic on racial inequality in the United States.},

abstract = {In this article, we consider the effect of criminal records on college admissions. Nearly 72 percent of colleges require criminal history information during their application processes, which indicates that an applicant's criminal history could be a significant impediment to achieving the benefits associated with higher education. We conducted a modified experimental audit to learn whether and to what extent criminal records affect admissions decisions. Matched same-race pairs of tester applications were sent to a national sample of nonelite 4-year colleges, with both testers applying as either Black or White. Within each pair, one application signaled a prior low-level felony conviction only when required by the application. Consistent with the findings of research on employment, we find the rejection rate for applicants with felony convictions was nearly 2.5 times the rate of our control testers. Relative to the large racial differences observed in previous studies of hiring decisions, we find smaller racial differences in admissions decisions. Nevertheless, Black applicants with criminal records were particularly penalized when disclosing a felony record at colleges with high campus crime rates. We address implications for reentry, racial progress, and the college “Ban the Box” movement. We suggest colleges consider narrowing the scope of such inquiries or removing the question altogether – particularly when it conflicts with the goals of these institutions, including reducing the underrepresentation of students of color.”.},

It uses data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Mature Women (NLSMW) and spans the years from 1967 to 1999. Results suggest that if other factors are controlled, the amount of work low-income women do in midlife has little effect on their economic well-being in old age.

We utilize essentially all the systematic information available on homelessness in US urban areas - census counts, shelter bed counts, records of transfer payments, and administrative agency estimates. We use these data to estimate the effects of housing prices, vacancies, and rentto-income ratios upon the incidence of homelessness. Our results suggest that simple economic principles governing the availability and pricing of housing and the growth in demand for the lowest quality housing explain a large portion of the variation in homelessness among US metropolitan housing markets. Furthermore, rather modest improvements in the affordability of rental housing or its availability can substantially reduce the incidence of homelessness in the US.},

abstract = {This paper presents a quarterly global model combining individual country vector error-correcting models in which the domestic variables are related to the country-specific foreign variables. The global VAR (GVAR) model is estimated for 26 countries, the euro area being treated as a single economy, over the period 1979–2003. It advances research in this area in a number of directions. In particular, it provides a theoretical framework where the GVAR is derived as an approximation to a global unobserved common factor model. Using average pair-wise cross-section error correlations, the GVAR approach is shown to be quite effective in dealing with the common factor interdependencies and international co-movements of business cycles. It develops a sieve bootstrap procedure for simulation of the GVAR as a whole, which is then used in testing the structural stability of the parameters, and for establishing bootstrap confidence bounds for the impulse responses. Finally, in addition to generalized impulse responses, the current paper considers the use of the GVAR for ‘structural' impulse response analysis with focus on external shocks for the euro area economy, particularly in response to shocks to the US.},

One potential partial explanation is that residents of some neighbourhoods face discrimination from employers. Although studies of deprived areas have recorded resident perceptions of discrimination by employers and negative employer perceptions of certain areas, until now there has been no direct evidence on whether employers treat job applicants differently by area of residence. This paper reports a unique experiment to test for a neighbourhood reputation effect involving 2001 applications to 667 real jobs by fictional candidates nominally resident in neighbourhoods with poor and bland reputations. The experiment found no statistically significant difference in employer treatment of applicants from these areas, indicating that people living in neighbourhoods with poor reputations did not face 'postcode discrimination' in the labour market, at the initial selection stage. {\textcopyright} 2013 Urban Studies Journal Limited.},

Elite audit studies are a type of field experiment used by researchers to test for discrimination against vulnerable populations seeking to access government resources. These studies have provided invaluable insights, but they have done so at the cost of using deception. They have relied on identity, activity, and motivation deception. In addition, they request unnecessary work. Is there a less deceptive alternative? In this article, I present results from a field experiment with state legislative offices that minimize the use of deception. Consistent with elite correspondence audit studies, I find evidence of discrimination against Hispanics among state legislative offices. In addition, I find that discrimination is mitigated when subjects believe their behavior will be public knowledge. This suggests that discrimination can be mitigated through increased monitoring. This article advances the discussion on how to minimize the use of deception in elite field experimentation and how to mitigate discrimination against vulnerable populations.},

In this study, we identify hiring discrimination against former juvenile delinquents in a direct way. To this end, we conduct a field experiment in the Belgian labour market. We find that labour market discrimination is indeed a major barrier in the transition to work for former juvenile delinquents. Labour market entrants disclosing a history of juvenile delinquency get about 22{\%} less callback compared to their counterparts without a criminal record. This discrimination is heterogeneous by the occupation for which one applies.},

abstract = {This paper assesses when the validity of difference-in-differences and related estimators is dependent on functional form. We provide a novel characterization: the parallel trends assumption holds under all monotonic transformations of the outcome if and only if a stronger “parallel trends”-type assumption holds on the entire distribution of potential outcomes. This assumption necessarily holds when treatment is (as if) randomly assigned, but will often be implausible in settings where randomization fails. We show further that the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) is identified regardless of functional form if and only if the entire distribution of untreated outcomes is identified for the treated group. It is thus impossible to construct an estimator that is consistent (or unbiased) for the ATT regardless of functional form unless one imposes assumptions that identify the entire counterfactual distribution of untreated potential outcomes. Our results suggest that researchers who wish to point-identify the ATT should justify one of the following: (i) why treatment is randomly assigned, (ii) why the chosen functional form is correct at the exclusion of others, or (iii) a method for inferring the entire counterfactual distribution of untreated potential outcomes.},

abstract = {This paper introduces the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method to be applied in explaining inequality in health outcome across any two groups. In order to understand every aspect of the inequality, multiple regression model can be used in a way to decompose the inequality into contributing factors. The method can therefore be indicated to what extent of the difference in mean predicted outcome between two groups is due to differences in the levels of observable characteristics (acceptable and fair). Assuming the identical characteristics in the two groups, the remaining inequality can be due to differential effects of the characteristics, maybe discrimination, and unobserved factors that not included in the model. Thus, using the decomposition methods can identify the contribution of each particular factor in moderating the current inequality. Accordingly, more detailed information can be provided for policy-makers, especially concerning modifiable factors. The method is theoretically described in detail and schematically presented. In the following, some criticisms of the model are reviewed, and several statistical commands are represented for performing the method, as well. Furthermore, the application of it in the health inequality with an applied example is presented.},

When surveyed, physicians report that the patient's sex has no effect on their decision-making; however, what occurs in clinical practice may be different. The purpose of our study was to determine whether patients' sex affects physicians' decisions to refer a patient for, or to perform, total knee arthroplasty.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Seventy-one physicians (38 family physicians and 33 orthopedic surgeons) in Ontario performed blinded assessments of 2 standardized patients (1 man and 1 woman) with moderate knee osteoarthritis who differed only by sex. The standardized patients recorded the physicians' final recommendations about total knee arthroplasty. Four surgeons did not consent to the inclusion of their data. After detecting an overall main effect, we tested for an interaction with physician type (family physician v. orthopedic surgeon). We used a binary logistic regression analysis with a generalized estimating equation approach to assess the effect of patients' sex on physicians' recommendations for total knee arthroplasty.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In total, 42{\%} of physicians recommended total knee arthroplasty to the male but not the female standardized patient, and 8{\%} of physicians recommended total knee arthroplasty to the female but not the male standardized patient (odds ratio [OR] 4.2, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 2.4-7.3, p {\textless} 0.001; risk ratio [RR] 2.1, 95{\%} CI 1.5-2.8, p {\textless} 0.001). The odds of an orthopedic surgeon recommending total knee arthroplasty to a male patient was 22 times (95{\%} CI 6.4-76.0, p {\textless} 0.001) that for a female patient. The odds of a family physician recommending total knee arthroplasty to a male patient was 2 times (95{\%} CI 1.04-4.71, p = 0.04) that for a female patient.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERPRETATION: Physicians were more likely to recommend total knee arthroplasty to a male patient than to a female patient, suggesting that gender bias may contribute to the sex-based disparity in the rates of use of total knee arthroplasty.},

We find that Uber is a complement for the average transit agency, increasing ridership by five percent after two years.

abstract = {A broad empirical literature uses “event study” research designs for treatment effect estimation, a setting in which all units in the panel receive treatment but at random times. We make four novel points about identification and estimation of causal effects in this setting and show their practical relevance. First, we show that in the presence of unit and time fixed effects, it is impossible to identify the linear component of the path of pre-trends and dynamic treatment effects. Second, we propose graphical and statistical tests for pre-trends. Third, we consider commonly-used “static” regressions, with a treatment dummy instead of a full set of leads and lags around the treatment event, and we show that OLS does not recover a reasonable weighted average of the treatment effects: long-run effects are weighted negatively, and we introduce different estimators robust to this issue. Fourth, we show that equivalent problems of under-identification and negative weighting arise in difference-in-differences settings when the control group is allowed to be on a different time trend or in the presence of unit-specific time trends. We show the practical relevance of these issues in a series of examples from the existing literature. We focus on the estimation of the marginal propensity to consume out of tax rebates: according to our preferred specification, the marginal propensity to consume is much lower than (about half of) the main estimates in the literature. The main message for practitioners is that because of identification issues and negative weighting in event study designs, results from common specifications are likely to seem non-robust. These problems can be alleviated in a principled way by using parametric and semi-parametric estimators and tests.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether physician estimates of pain severity are influenced by patient ethnicity. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: UCLA Emergency Medicine Center, a level I trauma center, Los Angeles, Calif. PARTICIPANTS: Hispanic and non-Hispanic white patients presenting to the emergency department with extremity trauma when research assistants were present. Exclusion criteria were patient refusal, altered mentation, or severe injury interfering with the interview process. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The difference between patient and physician estimates of pain severity as assessed on a visual analog scale for Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites. RESULTS: A total of 138 non-Hispanic white and 69 Hispanic patients participated in the study. The groups differed in language use, insurance status, and proportions suffering occupational injury. There were no differences between non-Hispanic white and Hispanic patients in patient pain assessments (mean, 39.8 mm vs 39.0 mm, respectively; P = .86), physician pain assessments (mean, 33.6 mm vs 29.7 mm; P = .23), or the disparity between patient and physician pain assessments (mean 6.1 mm vs 9.4 mm; P = .38). The degree of disparity between patient and physician pain assessments remained similar for both groups even after controlling for multiple potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Physician ability to assess pain severity does not differ for Hispanic and non-Hispanic white patients. Other explanations for a difference in analgesic practice as a function of ethnicity should be explored.},

abstract = {We examine how differences in model specifications and econometric methods affect unexplained wage differentials between workers with and without physical disabilities, where the unexplained differentials are estimates of the potential effects of disability-related wage discrimination. We apply an enhanced decomposition method (Neuman and Oaxaca, 2004) to selectivity-corrected wage equations to estimate potential discrimination effects. The decomposition separates observed wage differentials into a part explained by differences in characteristics that affect productivity and the decision to work and an unexplained part potentially attributed to discrimination. In addition to the functional limitation variables used to control for the effects of disability on productivity, we add measures of physical job demands, and interaction effects between functional limitations and job demands, to the wage models to examine how estimates of potential discrimination change. The interaction terms measure the extent to which workers' physical limitations affect important job functions. Data come from the 2004 SIPP merged to measures of job demands from the Occupational Information Network (O*Net). With job demands and interactions included in the model, approximately 10{\%} of the observed wage differential for men, and 20{\%} for women, is potentially attributed to discrimination. Changes in decomposition technique substantially alter the estimates of discrimination effects.},

abstract = {In this article, we consider the effect of criminal records on college admissions. Nearly 72 percent of colleges require criminal history information during their application processes, which indicates that an applicant's criminal history could be a significant impediment to achieving the benefits associated with higher education. We conducted a modified experimental audit to learn whether and to what extent criminal records affect admissions decisions. Matched same-race pairs of tester applications were sent to a national sample of nonelite 4-year colleges, with both testers applying as either Black or White. Within each pair, one application signaled a prior low-level felony conviction only when required by the application. Consistent with the findings of research on employment, we find the rejection rate for applicants with felony convictions was nearly 2.5 times the rate of our control testers. Relative to the large racial differences observed in previous studies of hiring decisions, we find smaller racial differences in admissions decisions. Nevertheless, Black applicants with criminal records were particularly penalized when disclosing a felony record at colleges with high campus crime rates. We address implications for reentry, racial progress, and the college “Ban the Box” movement. We suggest colleges consider narrowing the scope of such inquiries or removing the question altogether – particularly when it conflicts with the goals of these institutions, including reducing the underrepresentation of students of color.”.},

abstract = {In many parts of the world, the rewards attached to a university degree vary significantly according to the name of the institution one attends, particularly in countries with highly stratified postsecondary systems. Because the Canadian higher education system is relatively homogenous and non-hierarchical, it has been generally accepted that Canadian graduates enter the labour market on equal footing regardless of where they matriculate. We test this assumption through an experimental audit study that compares employers' responses to fictitious matched job applications from equally qualified bachelor's degree recipients from three Ontario universities: Brock, Queen's, and Waterloo. Not all employers make a distinction between the paired applications; but when they do, Waterloo is favoured. In these cases, even though applicants had the same field of study, academic achievement and work experience, employers singled out Waterloo applicants for a response 84{\%} more often than those from Brock. These findings indicate that institutional affiliation matters in Canada, and suggests that graduates from some institutions fare significantly better in the labour market than their equally accomplished peers from other institutions. We conclude that even in relatively non-hierarchical systems with comparatively minimal structural or resource variation, status hierarchies emerge that privilege some graduates over others.},

Data were collected using a cultural competency questionnaire and two implicit association tests (IATs). Race and skin tone IATs measure unconscious bias. Cultural competency scores were significantly higher for non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics in medicine and pharmacy compared with non-Hispanic Whites. Multiracial nursing students also had significantly higher cultural competency scores than non-Hispanic Whites. The IAT results indicate that these health care preprofessionals exhibit implicit race and skin tone biases: preferences for Whites versus Blacks and light skin versus dark skin. Cultural competency curricula and disparities research will be advanced by understanding the factors contributing to cultural competence and bias.},

This article provides an experimental test of whether neighborhood stigma affects individuals in one domain of social life: economic transactions. To evaluate the neighborhood stigma hypothesis, this study adopts an audit design in a locally organized, online classified market, using advertisements for used iPhones and randomly manipulating the neighborhood of the seller. The primary outcome under study is the number of responses generated by sellers from disadvantaged relative to advantaged neighborhoods. Advertisements from disadvantaged neighborhoods received significantly fewer responses than advertisements from advantaged neighborhoods. Results provide robust evidence that individuals from disadvantaged neighborhoods bear a stigma that influences their prospects in economic exchanges. The stigma is greater for advertisements originating from disadvantaged neighborhoods where the majority of residents are black. This evidence reveals that residence in a disadvantaged neighborhood not only affects individuals through mechanisms involving economic resources, institutional quality, and social networks but also affects residents through the perceptions of others.},

Most studies find that minorities are less likely to own a home than their white counterparts. A logical extension of this line of research is to consider whether home-ownership rates differ based on sexual orientation. We use data on couples from the 2000 Census and find that same-sex couples are less likely to own a home than are married couples. The average value of houses owned by same-sex male couples is statistically similar to the average value of houses owned by married couples, but houses owned by same-sex female and cohabiting couples have lower average values than those owned by married couples. Conditional on owning, same-sex couples are slightly less likely to have a mortgage compared to married couples. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The experimental design, which includes data gathered from more than 1100 market participants, provides sharp findings: (i) there is a strong tendency for minorities to receive initial and final offers that are inferior to those received by majorities, and (ii) overall, the data indicate that the observed discrimination is not due to animus, but represents statistical discrimination.},

Drawing on theories of planned behavior and core self-evaluations, this research investigated the impact of negative attitudes toward older workers on hiring decisions and examined the moderating role of decision-makers' core self-evaluations. We tested our hypotheses based on a structured online questionnaire and a vignette study using a sample of 102 participants working in human resource management across different industries. As predicted, negative attitudes toward older workers were positively related to avoidance of hiring older people, which in turn was negatively related to the likelihood to select the oldest candidate. Because hiring decisions are not only about the hiring subject but also about the decision-maker, we tested the moderating role of decision-makers' core self-evaluations. Results showed that core self-evaluations buffered the relationship between negative attitudes toward older workers and avoidance of hiring older people. Theoretical implications of the findings with regard to hiring decisions about older people and practical recommendations to improve diversity management strategies and age-balanced hiring practices in organizations are discussed.},

These studies reveal that: (1) positive older age stereotype characteristics are viewed less favorably as criteria for job hire, (2) even when the job role is low-status, a younger stereotype profile tends to be preferred, and (3) an older stereotype profile is only considered hirable when the role is explicitly cast as subordinate to that of a candidate with a younger age profile.

Cuts in state government fiscal assistance to their local governments, plus shrinking property tax bases are challenging the ability of local governments to continue their current levels of public services. In this paper, we use data on the financing of the nation's largest central cities from 1997 to 2008 to forecast the impact of the recession and the housing crisis on central city expenditures between 2009 and 2013. Because expenditure responsibilities vary among city governments and because overlying governments play different roles, we develop the concept of constructed governments in order to allow us to compare the revenue-raising and spending policies of large central cities. We predict that real per capita spending in the average central city will be reduced by about seven percent during the forecast period, and that spending cuts will be substantially greater in cities hit hardest by the economic recession and the housing market collapse. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A regression discontinuity (RD) research design is appropriate for program evaluation problems in which treatment status (or the probability of treatment) depends on whether an observed covariate exceeds a fixed threshold. In many applications the treatment-determining covariate is discrete. This makes it impossible to compare outcomes for observations "just above" and "just below" the treatment threshold, and requires the researcher to choose a functional form for the relationship between the treatment variable and the outcomes of interest. We propose a simple econometric procedure to account for uncertainty in the choice of functional form for RD designs with discrete support. In particular, we model deviations of the true regression function from a given approximating function-the specification errors-as random. Conventional standard errors ignore the group structure induced by specification errors and tend to overstate the precision of the estimated program impacts. The proposed inference procedure that allows for specification error also has a natural interpretation within a Bayesian framework. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Only 357 of these communities are consistently included in the most comprehensive public data source on economic activity, the Community Well-Being (CWB) Database. We propose using nighttime light density measured by satellites as an alternative indicator of well-being. We show that nighttime light density is an effective proxy for per capita income in the Canadian context and provide evidence that existing publicly available databases on well-being consist of heavily selected samples that systematically exclude many of the least developed communities. We show that sample selection into the publicly available data can lead to incorrect conclusions based on three applications: (i) the comparison of well-being across community types over time; (ii) an analysis of the historical and geographic determinants of economic activity in Indigenous communities; and (iii) a study of the effects of mining intensity close to Indigenous communities. Based on these applications, we suggest that using nighttime light density overcomes the biased selection of communities into the publicly available samples and, thus, may present a more complete picture of economic activity in Canada for Indigenous people.},

abstract = {Recognizing the need to better measure the magnitude of IPV and resulting economic costs—in particular, those related to health care—the U.S. Congress funded the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to conduct a study to obtain national estimates of the incidence of injuries resulting from IPV, to estimate the costs of injuries to health care facilities, and to recommend strategies to reduce IPV-related injuries and associated costs. Language related to this funding was included in the Violence Against Women Act provisions of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (P.L. 103–322). Given the greater number of IPV-related injuries that occur among women and the instability of cost estimates based on the small numbers of IPV-related injuries among men, this report focuses only on the costs of IPV against women ages 18 and older. Although Congress called only for costs of IPV-related injuries, it was important to include the costs of lost productivity resulting from IPV and to determine the economic costs of lives lost to IPV homicide. These costs contribute significantly to the economic burden of IPV.

abstract = {The low representation of female workers in elite jobs is sometimes attributed to a tail effect: If the human capital distribution exhibits less variation among females than among males, then even with comparable average human capital there will be fewer females in the right tail than males. This paper offers an explanation for why the human capital distribution might have this property. We show that the belief that the female human capital distribution has a lower variance than the male distribution can be self-fulfilling, in that it provides individuals with incentives to invest in human capital such that the resulting distribution exhibits exactly this characteristic. If this happens, fewer females are employed in high-end jobs (a "glass ceiling" effect). The average productivity of female workers may at the same time be higher than that of male workers. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Using data from 1988 to 1999, I estimate that Cook increased employment for obese women and men relative to those whose weight was in the recommended range on the order of four and two percentage points, respectively.

I find that same-sex male couples, especially non-White same-sex male couples, are less likely to receive a response to inquiries about rental units. I also find that same-sex Black male couples are subject to more subtle forms of discrimination than heterosexual Black couples are. I then examine whether state and local antidiscrimination laws covary with rates of housing discrimination against same-sex couples. Although my results are not causal, I find that antidiscrimination laws have an ambiguous relationship with rates of discrimination faced by same-sex couples. State-level housing protections, for example, covary positively with response rates for same-sex Black male couples, whereas local-level laws covary negatively with response rates for these couples.},

In practice, however, different DID procedures rely on different parallel trends assumptions (PTA), and recover different causal parameters. In this paper, we focus on staggered DID (also referred as event-studies) and discuss the role played by the PTA in terms of identification and estimation of causal parameters. We document a “robustness” vs. “efficiency” trade-off in terms of the strength of the underlying PTA, and argue that practitioners should be explicit about these trade-offs whenever using DID procedures. We propose new DID estimators that reflect these tradeoffs and derived their large sample properties. We illustrate the practical relevance of these results by assessing whether the transition from federal to state management of the Clean Water Act affects compliance rates.},

abstract = {The influence of peers could play an important role in the take up of social programs. However, estimating peer effects has proven challenging given the problems of reflection, correlated unobservables, and endogenous group membership. We overcome these identification issues in the context of paid paternity leave in Norway using a regression discontinuity design. In an attempt to promote gender equality, a reform made fathers of children born after April 1, 1993 in Norway eligible for one month of governmental paid paternity leave. Fathers of children born before this cutoff were not eligible. There is a sharp increase in fathers taking paternity leave immediately after the reform, with take up rising from 3{\%} to 35{\%}. While this quasi-random variation changed the cost of paternity leave for some fathers and not others, it did not directly affect the cost for the father's coworkers or brothers. Therefore, any effect on the coworker or brother can be attributed to the influence of the peer father in their network. Our key findings on peer effects are four-fold. First, we find strong evidence for substantial peer effects of program participation in both workplace and family networks. Coworkers and brothers are 11 and 15 percentage points, respectively, more likely to take paternity leave if their peer father was induced to take up leave by the reform. Second, the most likely mechanism is information transmission about costs and benefits, including increased knowledge of how an employer will react. Third, there is essential heterogeneity in the size of the peer effect depending on the strength of ties between peers, highlighting the importance of duration, intensity, and frequency of social interactions. Fourth, the estimated peer effect gets amplified over time, with each subsequent birth exhibiting a snowball effect as the original peer father's influence cascades through a firm. Our findings demonstrate that peer effects can lead to long-run equilibrium participation rates which are substantially higher than would otherwise be expected.},

They find a surprising variety of shifting patterns. For some commodities, the after-tax price increases by exactly the amount of the tax, a result consistent with the standard competitive model. However, taxes on other commodities are overshifted--an increase in tax revenue of one dollar per unit increases the price by more than one dollar.},

Women with disabilities are twice disadvantaged in the labor market: They face possible discrimination based on both gender and disability status. This article focuses on transitions into new employment. Two key variables indicate the circumstances in which a woman starts working at a new employer: (a) a planned employment transition or (b) finding employment after leaving a former employer for an unplanned reason or after being unemployed. The empirical evidence suggests that wage discrimination is prevalent; discrimination occurs across personal and employment characteristics. Although employment transitions resulted in lower wages, reasonable scenarios that involve personal choices as opposed to discrimination could not be eliminated. For instance, a worker with disabilities may change employers and accept a lower wage if she gains nonwage benefits (e.g., accommodations or health insurance). {\textcopyright} 2004, Sage Publications.

In this design, local polynomial estimators are now routinely employed to construct con{\ldots}dence intervals for treatment e¤ects. The performance of these con{\ldots}dence intervals in applications, however, may be seriously hampered by their sensitivity to the speci{\ldots}c bandwidth employed. Available bandwidth selectors typically yield a “large”bandwidth, leading to data-driven con{\ldots}dence intervals that may be severely biased, with empirical coverage well below their nominal target. We propose new theory-based, more robust con{\ldots}dence interval estimators for average treatment e¤ects at the cuto¤ in sharp RD, sharp kink RD, fuzzy RD and fuzzy kink RD designs. Our proposed con{\ldots}dence intervals are constructed using a bias-corrected RD estimator together with a novel standard error estimator. For practical implementation, we discuss mean-square error optimal bandwidths, which are by construction not valid for conventional con{\ldots}dence intervals but valid with our robust approach, and consistent standard error estimators based on our new variance formulas. Among other possibilities, our results give formal justi{\ldots}cation to simple inference procedures based on increasing the order of the local polynomial estimators employed. We find in a simulation study that our con{\ldots}dence intervals exhibit close-to-correct empirical coverage and good empirical interval length on average, remarkably improving upon the alternatives available in the literature.

As an illustration, we develop a novel simulation that enables us to generate TSCS data with varying over-time and cross-sectional effects and examine the behavior of the two-way FE model as these effects change. We demonstrate that the two-way FE model makes specific assumptions about TSCS datasets, and if these assumptions are not met, the model may be unidentified even if substantial variation exists along both dimensions. Because of the difficulty in interpretation, we do not recommend that applied researchers rely on the two-way FE model except for situations in which the assumptions are well-understood, such as the canonical difference-in-difference design.},

abstract = {Anti-discrimination laws on the basis of sexual orientation have been adopted by many states to counteract perceived discrimination in the labor market. However, we find the evidence of earnings disparities between homosexual and heterosexual men to be extremely sensitive to the choice of reference group. Relative to married heterosexual men, gay men earn less, and, over time, anti-discriminatory laws lessen this gap. Relative to unmarried, coupled heterosexual men, however, gay men experience similar levels of earnings. The choice of reference group leads to opposite conclusions regarding the effectiveness and necessity of an anti-discriminatory law for homosexual men, which highlights the need to construct reference groups with care. We also find that homosexual women experience similar earnings to their heterosexual female counterparts, and the law has no effect on these relative wages. {\textcopyright} Southern Regional Science Association 2014.},

abstract = {Despite extensive attention to racial disparities in police shootings, two problems have hindered progress on this issue. First, databases of fatal officer-involved shootings (FOIS) lack details about officers, making it difficult to test whether racial disparities vary by officer characteristics. Second, there are conflicting views on which benchmark should be used to determine racial disparities when the outcome is the rate at which members from racial groups are fatally shot. We address these issues by creating a database of FOIS that includes detailed officer information. We test racial disparities using an approach that sidesteps the benchmark debate by directly predicting the race of civilians fatally shot rather than comparing the rate at which racial groups are shot to some benchmark. We report three main findings: 1) As the proportion of Black or Hispanic officers in a FOIS increases, a person shot is more likely to be Black or Hispanic than White, a disparity explained by county demographics; 2) race-specific county-level violent crime strongly predicts the race of the civilian shot; and 3) although we find no overall evidence of anti-Black or anti-Hispanic disparities in fatal shootings, when focusing on different subtypes of shootings (e.g., unarmed shootings or “suicide by cop”), data are too uncertain to draw firm conclusions. We highlight the need to enforce federal policies that record both officer and civilian information in FOIS.},

Previous research overstates the impact of the incentives on saving by failing to account for several issues: households with saving incentives have stronger tastes for saving than others; saving incentives have interacted with debt, nonfinancial assets, financial markets, and pensions; and saving incentives represent pretax balances, whereas taxable accounts represent posttax balances. Accounting for these issues essentially eliminates the impact of saving incentives on saving. The authors conclude that little if any of the contributions to existing saving incentives have raised saving.},

These problems may often start prior to young adulthood; however, relatively little is known about risk for substance use in LGB adolescents. The primary aims of this paper were to conduct a meta-analysis of the relationship between sexual orientation and adolescent substance use and a systematic review and critique of the methodological characteristics of this literature.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Medical and social science journals were searched using Medline and PsychInfo. Studies were included if they tested the relationship between sexual orientation and adolescent substance use. Eighteen published studies were identified. Data analysis procedures followed expert guidelines, and used National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored meta-analysis software.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: LGB adolescents reported higher rates of substance use compared to heterosexual youth (overall odds ratio = 2.89, Cohen's d = 0.59). Effect sizes varied by gender, bisexuality status, sexual orientation definition and recruitment source. None of the studies tested mediation and only one tested moderation. One employed a matched comparison group design, one used a longitudinal design, and very few controlled for possible confounding variables.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The odds of substance use for LGB youth were, on average, 190{\%} higher than for heterosexual youth and substantially higher within some subpopulations of LGB youth (340{\%} higher for bisexual youth, 400{\%} higher for females). Causal mechanisms, protective factors and alternative explanations for this effect, as well as long-term substance use outcomes in LGB youth, remain largely unknown.},

abstract = {We consider a new, flexible and easy-to-implement method to estimate thecausal effects of an intervention on a single treated unit when a control group is not available and which nests previous proposals in the literature. It is a two-step methodology where in the first stage, a counterfactual is estimated based on a large-dimensional set of variables from a pool of untreated units by means of shrinkage methods, such as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). In the second stage, we estimate the average intervention effect on a vector of variables, which is consistent and asymptotically normal. Our results are valid uniformly over a wide class of probability laws. We show that these results hold even when the exact date of the intervention is unknown. Tests for multiple interventions and for contamination effects are derived. By a simple transformation of the variables, it is possible to test for multivariate intervention effects on several moments of the variables of interest. Existing methods in the literature usually test for intervention effects on a single variable and assume that the time of the intervention is known. In addition, high-dimensionality is frequently ignored and inference is either conducted under a set of more stringent hypotheses and/or by permutation tests. A Monte Carlo experiment evaluates the properties of the method in finite samples and compares it with other alternatives. As an application, we evaluate the effects on inflation, GDP growth, retail sales and credit of an anti tax-evasion program.},

Analysis of 134 samples suggests that when weighting each study's contribution by sample size, perceived discrimination has a significant negative effect on both mental and physical health. Perceived discrimination also produces significantly heightened stress responses and is related to participation in unhealthy and nonparticipation in healthy behaviors.

This perspective suggests a generalization with two way (both unit and time) fixed effects, and both unit and time weights, which can be interpreted as a unit and time weighted version of the standard Difference In Differences (DID) estimator. We find that this new Synthetic Difference In Differences (SDID) estimator has attractive properties compared to the SC and DID estimators. Formally we show that our approach has double robustness properties: the SDID estimator is consistent under a wide variety of weighting schemes given a well-specified fixed effects model, and SDID is consistent with appropriately penalized SC weights when the basic fixed effects model is misspecified and instead the true data generating process involves a more general low-rank structure (e.g., a latent factor model). We also present results that justify standard inference based on weighted DID regression. Further generalizations include unit and time weighted factor models.},

abstract = {An important problem in multilevel modeling is what constitutes a sufficient sample size for accurate estimation. In multilevel analysis, the major restriction is often the higher-level sample size. In this paper, a simulation study is used to determine the influence of different sample sizes at the group level on the accuracy of the estimates (regression coefficients and variances) and their standard errors. In addition, the influence of other factors, such as the lowest-level sample size and different variance distributions between the levels (different intraclass correlations), is examined. The results show that only a small sample size at level two (meaning a sample of 50 or less) leads to biased estimates of the second-level standard errors. In all of the other simulated conditions the estimates of the regression coefficients, the variance components, and the standard errors are unbiased and accurate.},

abstract = {Discrimination in the workplace is illegal, yet discriminatory practices remain a persistent global problem. To identify discriminatory practices in the workplace, job advertisement analysis was used by previous studies. However, most of those studies adopted content analysis by manually coding the text from a limited number of samples since working with a large scale of job advertisements consisting of unstructured text data is very challenging. Encountering those limitations, the present study involves text mining techniques to identify multiple types of direct discrimination on a large scale of online job advertisements by designing a method called Direct Discrimination Detection (DDD). The DDD is constructed using a combination of N-grams and regular expressions (regex) with the exact match principle of a Boolean retrieval model. A total of 8,969 online job advertisements in English and Bahasa Indonesia, published from May 2005 to December 2017 were collected from bursakerja-jateng.com as the data. The results reveal that the practices of direct discrimination still exist during the job-hunting process including gender, marital status, physical appearances, and religion. The most recurrent type of discrimination which occurs in job advertisements is based on age (66.27{\%}), followed by gender (38.76{\%}), and physical appearances (18.42{\%}). Additionally, female job seekers are found as the most vulnerable party to experience direct discrimination during recruitment. The results exhibit female job seekers face complex jeopardy in particular job positions comparing to their male counterparts. Not only excluded because of their gender, but female job seekers also had to fulfil more requirements for getting an opportunity to apply for the jobs such as being single, still at a young age, complying specific physical appearances and particular religious preferences. This study illustrates the power and potential of optimizing computational methods on a large scale of unstructured text data to analyze phenomena in the social field.},

In the 40‐plus year history of estimates of returns to investment in education, there have been several reviews of the empirical results in attempts to establish patterns.

This paper reviews and presents the latest estimates and patterns as found in the literature at the turn of the century.

abstract = {This book is unique in that it covers the philosophy of model-based data analysis and an omnibus strategy for the analysis of empirical data. The book introduces information theoretic approaches and focuses critical attention on a priori modeling and the selection of a good approximating model that best represents the inference supported by the data. Kullback-Leibler information represents a fundamental quantity in science and is Hirotugu Akaike's basis for model selection. The maximized log-likelihood function can be bias-corrected to provide an estimate of expected, relative Kullback-Leibler information. This leads to Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and various extensions and these are relatively simple and easy to use in practice, but little taught in statistics classes and far less understood in the applied sciences than should be the case. The information theoretic approaches provide a unified and rigorous theory, an extension of likelihood theory, an important application of information theory, and are objective and practical to employ across a very wide class of empirical problems. Parameter estimation has long been viewed as an optimization problem (e.g., maximize the log-likelihood or minimize the residual sum of squared deviations) and under the information theoretic paradigm, data-based model selection is also an optimization problem. This brings model selection and parameter estimation under a common framework - optimization. The value of AIC is computed for each a priori model to be considered and the model with the minimum AIC is used for statistical inference. However, the paradigm described in this book goes beyond merely the computation and interpretation of AIC to select a parsimonious model for inference from empirical data; it refocuses increased attention on a variety of considerations and modeling prior to the actual analysis of data.},

abstract = {In some applications, researchers using the synthetic control method (SCM) to evaluate the effect of a policy may struggle to determine whether they have identified a "good match"between the control group and treated group. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of the mean and maximum Absolute Standardized Mean Difference (ASMD) as a test of balance between a synthetic control unit and treated unit, and provide guidance on what constitutes a poor fit when using a synthetic control. We explore and compare other potential metrics using a simulation study. We provide an application of our proposed balance metric to the 2013 Los Angeles (LA) Firearm Study [9]. Using Uniform Crime Report data, we apply the SCM to obtain a counterfactual for the LA firearm-related crime rate based on a weighted combination of control units in a donor pool of cities. We use this counterfactual to estimate the effect of the LA Firearm Study intervention and explore the impact of changing the donor pool and pre-intervention duration period on resulting matches and estimated effects. We demonstrate how decision-making about the quality of a synthetic control can be improved by using ASMD. The mean and max ASMD clearly differentiate between poor matches and good matches. Researchers need better guidance on what is a meaningful imbalance between synthetic control and treated groups. In addition to the use of gap plots, the proposed balance metric can provide an objective way of determining fit.},

However, there is a comparative lack of empirical literature exploring why states adopt different types of tax incentives. This article draws on the literatures on tax competition and policy diffusion to develop hypotheses about what factors motivate states to adopt business tax incentives, paying particular attention to the influence of other adopting states. It uses event history analysis methods to test hypotheses regarding the adoption of four state tax incentive policies: investment tax credits, apportionment formula changes, research and development tax credits, and job creation tax credits. Regression results show that factors that influence adoption decisions are largely inconsistent across the four incentive types. However, analyses of duration dependence find evidence consistent with the idea that states are “racing to the bottom.” },

abstract = {The Moving to Opportunity (MTO) experiment offered randomly selected families living in high- poverty housing projects housing vouchers to move to lower-poverty neighborhoods. We present new evidence on the impacts ofMTOon children's long-term outcomes using administrative data from tax returns. We find that moving to a lower-poverty neighborhood significantly improves college attendance rates and earnings for children who were young (below age 13) when their families moved. These children also live in better neighborhoods themselves as adults and are less likely to become single parents. The treatment effects are substantial: children whose families take up an experimental voucher to move to a lower-poverty area when they are less than 13 years old have an annual income that is {\$}3,477 (31{\%}) higher on average relative to a mean of {\$}11,270 in the control group in their mid-twenties. In contrast, the same moves have, if anything, negative long-term impacts on children who are more than 13 years old when their families move, perhaps because of the disruption effects of moving to a very different environment. The gains from moving fall with the age when children move, consistent with recent evidence that the duration of exposure to a better environment during childhood is a key determinant of an individual's long-term outcomes. The findings imply that offering vouchers to move to lower-poverty neighborhoods to families with young children who are living in high- poverty housing projects may reduce the intergenerational persistence of poverty and ultimately generate positive returns for taxpayers.},

abstract = {An important stylized fact about labor markets is that workers with longer seniority with their current employer have higher earnings than other workers with the same total labor market experience. This study shows that workers in longer jobs earn more throughout than workers in a series of shorter jobs and that the measured positive cross-sectional return seniority is largely a statistical artifact due to the correlation of seniority with an omitted variable representing the quality of the worker, the job, or the worker-employer match. The implication is tha t earnings do not, in fact, rise very much with seniority. Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.},

A search of existing academic literature, public health reports, and advocacy group publications revealed 33 studies that contained information about transgender people's interactions with LECJ personnel. Results highlight how large percentages of transgender people experience arrest and incarceration, unjustified stops and arrest, disrespect and poor case handling, and abuse and violence from LECJ personnel while in their communities. Large percentages of transgender people in institutional settings also reported abuse committed by criminal justice personnel, including harassment, assault, and a lack of protection from other inmates. This review also highlights evidence of discriminatory and abusive treatment when transgender victims seek assistance from the legal system. Taken together, this study suggests a need for further work to de-stigmatize the legal and criminal justice systems. {\textcopyright} 2014 .},

abstract = {The CARES Act expanded unemployment insurance (UI) benefits by providing a {\$}600 weekly payment in addition to state unemployment benefits. Most workers thus became eligible to receive unemployment benefits that exceed their weekly wages. It has been hypothesized that such high benefits encourage employers to lay off workers and discourage workers from returning to work. In this note, we test whether changes in UI benefit generosity are associated with decreased employment, both at the onset of the benefits expansion and as businesses look to reopen. We use weekly data from Homebase, a private firm that provides scheduling and time clock software to small businesses, which allows us to exploit high-frequency changes in state and federal policies to understand how firms and workers respond to policy changes in real time. Additionally, we benchmark our results from the Homebase data to employment outcomes in the Current Population Survey (CPS). We find that that the workers who experienced larger increases in UI generosity did not experience larger declines in employment when the benefits expansion went into effect. Additionally, we find that workers facing larger expansions in UI benefits have returned to their previous jobs over time at similar rates as others. We find no evidence that more generous benefits disincentivized work either at the onset of the expansion or as firms looked to return to business over time. In future research, it will be important to assess whether the same results hold when states move to reopen, and to analyze the effects of high UI replacement rates on reallocation of labor both within and across firms.},

By using a large dataset of in-match data in the English Premier League, we show that white referees award significantly more yellow cards against non-white players of oppositional identity. We argue that this is the result of implicit discrimination by showing that this discriminatory behaviour: (i) increases in how rushed the referee is before making a decision, and (ii) it increases in the level of ambiguity of the decision. The variation in (i) and (ii) cannot be explained by any form of conscious discrimination such as taste-based or statistical discrimination. Moreover, we show that oppositional identity players do not differ in their behaviour from other players along several dimensions related to aggressiveness and style of play providing further evidence that this is not statistical discrimination.},

If the assignment variable is measured with error, however, the discontinuity in the relationship between the probability of treatment and the observed mismeasured assignment variable may disappear. Therefore, the presence of measurement error in the assignment variable poses a challenge to treatment effect identification. This chapter provides sufficient conditions to identify the RD treatment effect using the mismeasured assignment variable, the treatment status and the outcome variable. We prove identification separately for discrete and continuous assignment variables and study the properties of various estimation procedures. We illustrate the proposed methods in an empirical application, where we estimate Medicaid takeup and its crowdout effect on private health insurance coverage.},

abstract = {To understand gender differences in the job search process, we collect rich information on job offers and acceptances from past and current undergraduates of Boston University's Questrom School of Business. We document two novel empirical facts: (1) there is a clear gender difference in the timing of job offer acceptance, with women accepting jobs substantially earlier than men, and (2) the gender earnings gap in accepted offers narrows in favor of women over the course of the job search period. Using survey data on risk preferences and beliefs about expected future earnings, we present empirical evidence that the patterns in job search can be partly explained by the higher levels of risk aversion displayed by women and the higher levels of overoptimism (and slower belief updating) displayed by men. We develop a job search model that incorporates these gender differences in risk aversion and (over)optimism about prospective offers. Our counterfactual exercises show that simple policies such as eliminating ``exploding offers" by allowing students to hold onto offers for an additional month, or providing them with accurate information about the labor market, can reduce the gender gap significantly.},

Although it is possible to identify such students, there remains an inevitable tradeoff in any resource allocation between not treating the students who are likely to exit without treatment and treating students who are likely not to exit in the absence of the treatment. At-risk students are found to remain at risk throughout their college career. Moreover, conditional on exiting the institution, the degree to which the student was at risk is predictive of whether the student subsequently re-enrolls elsewhere and the type of institution at which this re-enrollment occurs. In this context, we discuss how retention policies relate to insuring the initial match is appropriate, recognizing that some attrition can be in keeping with the broad social interest.

We motivate our analysis using Becker's model of racial bias, which predicts that rates of pretrial misconduct will be identical for marginal white and marginal black defendants if bail judges are racially unbiased. In contrast, marginal white defendants will have higher rates of misconduct than marginal black defendants if bail judges are racially biased, whether that bias is driven by racial animus, inaccurate racial stereotypes, or any other form of bias. To test the model, we use the release tendencies of quasi-randomly assigned bail judges to identify the relevant race-specific misconduct rates. Estimates from Miami and Philadelphia show that bail judges are racially biased against black defendants, with substantially more racial bias among both inexperienced and part-time judges. We find suggestive evidence that this racial bias is driven by bail judges relying on inaccurate stereotypes that exaggerate the relative danger of releasing black defendants.},

abstract = {Most sociological research on racial discrimination has had an “inter-racial” focus. That is, researchers have been principally concerned with the disparate treatment that people of color receive relative to Whites in different social contexts. However, recent theoretical work emerging from legal studies suggests that an alternative conception of “intra-racial” discrimination exists that extends beyond colorism. This theory of intra-racial discrimination stipulates that many organizations in the “post-racial” era desire some measure of racial diversity. Yet, in their efforts to achieve this racial diversity they screen people of color based on their degree of racial salience. Whether a given person of color is hired, promoted, or in the case of college admissions, accepted, is a function of whether or not Whites within the organization consider them racially palatable, or not overly concerned with race. This creates an incentive for people of color to work their identity to allay any concerns among Whites that they may be too racially salient. In this paper I critically review this work and attempt to further buttress its claims by highlighting how this process has clear historical precedent. I conclude by showing how the audit method can be used to empirically examine this practice contemporarily.},

For these women, displays of highbrow taste-the cultural signals of a higher-class background-generate significantly higher rates of employer callback than displays of lowbrow taste-the cultural signals of a lower-class background. Meanwhile, cultural signals of class have no systematic effect on the callback rates of male and/or non-customer-facing job applicants. Results from a survey-experimental study of 1,428 U.S. hiring managers suggest that these differing patterns of employer callback may be explained by the positive effect of higher-class cultural signals on perceptions of polish and competence and their negative effect on perceptions of warmth.},

Fifty-eight percent of employees in Study 1 were exposed to sexual behavior in the past 2 years; 40{\%} of employees in Study 2 were exposed to sexual behavior in the past year.

abstract = {Intersectionality is a term used to describe the intersecting effects of race, class, gender, and other marginalizing characteristics that contribute to social identity and affect health. Adverse health effects are thought to occur via social processes including discrimination and structural inequalities (i.e., reduced opportunities for education and income). Although intersectionality has been well-described conceptually, approaches to modeling it in quantitative studies of health outcomes are still emerging. Strategies to date have focused on modeling demographic characteristics as proxies for structural inequality. Our objective was to extend these methodological efforts by modeling intersectionality across three levels: structural, contextual, and interpersonal, consistent with a social-ecological framework. We conducted a secondary analysis of a database that included two components of a widely used survey instrument, the Everyday Discrimination Scale. We operationalized a meso- or interpersonal-level of intersectionality using two variables, the frequency score of discrimination experiences and the sum of characteristics listed as reasons for these (i.e., the person's race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, disability or pregnancy status, or physical appearance). We controlled for two structural inequality factors (low education, poverty) and three contextual factors (high crime neighborhood, racial minority status, and trauma exposures). The outcome variables we modeled were posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and a quality of life index score. We used data from 619 women who completed the Everyday Discrimination Scale for a perinatal study in the U.S. state of Michigan. Statistical results indicated that the two interpersonal-level variables (i.e., number of marginalized identities, frequency of discrimination) explained 15{\%} of variance in posttraumatic stress symptoms and 13{\%} of variance in quality of life scores, improving the predictive value of the models over those using structural inequality and contextual factors alone. This study's results point to instrument development ideas to improve the statistical modeling of intersectionality in health and social science research. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We study the link between family violence and the emotional cues associated with wins and losses by professional football teams. We hypothesize that the risk of violence is affected by the "gain-loss" utility of game outcomes around a rationally expected reference point. Our empirical analysis uses police reports of violent incidents on Sundays during the professional football season. Controlling for the pregame point spread and the size of the local viewing audience, we find that upset losses (defeats when the home team was predicted tow in by four or more points) lead to a 10{\%} increase in the rate of at-home violence by men against the irwives and girlfriends. In contrast, losses when the game was expected to be close have small and insignificant effects. Upset wins (victories when the home team was predicted to lose) also have little impact on violence, consistent with asymmetry in the gain-loss utility function. The rise in violence after an upset loss is concentrated in a narrow time window near the end of the game and is larger for more important games. We find no evidence for reference point updating based on the halftime score. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2011.},

The authors provide detailed guidance on conducting the activity in upper-level economics courses, based on their experiences while teaching labor economics, public economics, urban economics, health economics, and econometrics. They argue that their activity provides a meaningful way to integrate recent research, policy topics, and diversity issues while promoting student-student interactions.

We develop a methodological framework that compares how well various reform proposals are targeted to reducing poverty among elderly women. METHODS: Using a microsimulation model and survey data matched to SSI administrative records, we model the effects of eight alternative policies on current and potential SSI recipients. We develop an evaluation methodology that systematically compares poverty outcomes, using multiple measures of effectiveness, at given levels of program expansion. RESULTS: All but two of the SSI reforms are clearly more target efficient at various degrees of simulated program expansion than popular proposals to reform Social Security. For a given cost increase, modifying the SSI asset test is the most effective option for reducing severe poverty among elderly women, but several reforms of the SSI income test are also highly effective. DISCUSSION: The SSI program is target efficient in providing a broad safety net to economically vulnerable elderly women. The relationship between SSI and Social Security and the relationship between the SSI asset and income tests have to be reevaluated to make the program more effective and appropriate to changing household structure and work patterns among the elderly population.},

We focus mainly on dismissals protection, distinguishing between the themes of employment and unemployment development and labor market dynamics proper. Our discussion of employment and unemployment largely deals with the effect of employment protection on levels of these outcome indicators. We distinguish between overall and compositional effects (e.g., by demographic group and type of contract), between developing and industrialized nations, and identify some key control variables. Our discussion of labor market dynamics focuses on the speed of adjustment issue and on gross flows. It also formalizes the link between analyses of levels and changes in variables. At all times potential offsets to the adverse effects of employment protection receive consideration.},

Data from a sample of 263 transgender individuals were used to evaluate the psychometric properties of the modified measures. Analyses of the structures of the modified measures (Transgender Forms [TF]) suggested an alternative 2-factor structure for the WHEQ-TF, but provided support for the previously observed unidimensional structure for the LGBTCI-TF, and a slightly modified 3-factor structure for the WSIMM-TF. Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficients for scale or subscale items across the 3 measures were acceptable. Criterion-related validity was evident in theoretically consistent patterns of correlations between scores on the 3 modified measures and scores on indicators of job satisfaction and outness. These data provide preliminary support for transgender-specific versions of measures of 3 key constructs in the sexual minority vocational behavior research. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Psychological Association.},

abstract = {The increase in the full retirement age in the Social Security program provides exogenous variation in the generosity in the Disability Insurance program, based only on birth year. We exploit this variation to estimate how responsive SSDI applications are to the financial incentive to apply. We find that a one percentage point decrease in the retirement-to-disability benefit ratio leads to a 0.25 percentage point increase in the DI application rate for the sample, which represents an 8 percent increase in applications per two years. When weighted to account for sampling design, we estimate that this change in the financial incentive accounted for about 5 percent of the SSDI applications in 2009. However, we do not find a corresponding increase in SSDI receipt based on the financial incentives. In addition, we find little difference in the covariates for individuals who eventually receive SSDI, suggesting that the increase in applications may increase the administrative costs of the SSDI program, but should not have a dramatic impact on the long-term financial solvency of the program.},

Agglomeration economies and human capital spillovers suggest that such policies could enhance welfare. However, the mere existence of agglomeration externalities does not indicate which places should be subsidized. Without a better understanding of nonlinearities in these externalities, any government spatial policy is as likely to reduce as to increase welfare. Transportation spending has historically done much to make or break particular places, but current transportation spending subsidizes low-income, low-density places where agglomeration effects are likely to be weakest. Most large-scale place-oriented policies have had little discernable impact. Some targeted policies such as Empowerment Zones seem to have an effect but are expensive relative to their achievements. The greatest promise for a national place-based policy lies in impeding the tendency of highly productive areas to restrict their own growth through restrictions on land use.},

This allows us to study how job seekers react to job characteristics - in analogy of usual randomised audit studies of employers' reactions to applicant characteristics. We focus on the reaction to wage announcements, and test the main implications of directed search: high wages should attract more and better applicants, but some applicants apply only to low wages even if higher wage offers are present. Both parts of the theory find support among the randomised job offers, suggesting an allocative role for wage competition in search markets. We calibrate a directed search model with multiple applications and on-the-job search and find that it can reproduce our findings quantitatively.},

Unemployment and economic hardship at the household level were positively related to abusive behavior. Further, rapid increases in the unemployment rate increased men's controlling behavior toward romantic partners even after we adjust for unemployment and economic distress at the household level. We interpret these findings as demonstrating that the uncertainty and anticipatory anxiety that go along with sudden macroeconomic downturns have negative effects on relationship quality, above and beyond the effects of job loss and material hardship.},

We discuss the advantages of these methods and apply them to study the effects of Proposition 99, a large-scale tobacco control program that California implemented in 1988. We demonstrate that, following Proposition 99, tobacco consumption fell markedly in California relative to a comparable synthetic control region. We estimate that by the year 2000 annual per-capita cigarette sales in California were about 26 packs lower than what they would have been in the absence of Proposition 99. Using new inferential methods proposed in this article, we demonstrate the significance of our estimates. Given that many policy interventions and events of interest in social sciences take place at an aggregate level (countries, regions, cities, etc.) and affect a small number of aggregate units, the potential applicability of synthetic control methods to comparative case studies is very large, especially in situations where traditional regression methods are not appropriate.},

abstract = {Background and purpose: Access to primary care remains a problem for a substantial portion of the U.S. population, and is predicted to worsen due to an aging population and the increasing burden of chronic diseases. Better integration of nurse practitioners (NPs) into the primary care workforce is a possible solution. We examine offers of appointments with NPs if a requested primary care physician is unavailable. Methods: Data are from a 2013 audit (simulated patient) study requesting appointment information from a national random sample of primary care physicians. Outcome variables include appointment offers, wait-to-appointment times, and appointment offers with alternate providers, including NPs. Conclusions: Of 922 calls to primary care physicians serving the general adult population, 378 (41{\%}) offered appointments with the requested physician. Alternate providers were offered by 63 (7{\%}), including nine offers with NPs ({\textless}1{\%}). Mean wait-to-appointment for NPs (3.6 days) was statistically significantly shorter (p-values {\textless}.01) than for requested physicians (22.5 days) or non-NP alternate providers (23.9 days). Implications for practice: NPs are an important part of the primary care workforce, and new patients seeking primary care physicians may substantially reduce their wait times if an NP is offered.},

abstract = {One explanation advanced for the persistent gender pay differences in labor markets is that women avoid salary negotiations. By using a natural field experiment that randomizes nearly 2,500 job seekers into jobs that vary important details of the labor contract, we are able to observe both the extent of salary negotiations and the nature of sorting. We find that when there is no explicit statement that wages are negotiable, men are more likely to negotiate for a higher wage, whereas women are more likely to signal their willingness to work for a lower wage. However, when we explicitly mention the possibility that wages are negotiable, these differences disappear completely. In terms of sorting, we find that men, in contrast to women, prefer job environments where the "rules of wage determination" are ambiguous. This leads to the gender gap being much more pronounced in jobs that leave negotiation of wage ambiguous.},

abstract = {Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an efficacious psychosocial intervention for recurrent depression (Kuyken et al., 2008; Ma {\&} Teasdale, 2004; Teasdale et al., 2000). To date, no compelling research addresses MBCT's mechanisms of change. This study determines whether MBCT's treatment effects are mediated by enhancement of mindfulness and self-compassion across treatment, and/or by alterations in post-treatment cognitive reactivity. The study was embedded in a randomized controlled trial comparing MBCT with maintenance antidepressants (mADM) with 15-month follow-up (Kuyken et al., 2008). Mindfulness and self-compassion were assessed before and after MBCT treatment (or at equivalent time points in the mADM group). Post-treatment reactivity was assessed one month after the MBCT group sessions or at the equivalent time point in the mADM group. One hundred and twenty-three patients with ≥3 prior depressive episodes, and successfully treated with antidepressants, were randomized either to mADM or MBCT. The MBCT arm involved participation in MBCT, a group-based psychosocial intervention that teaches mindfulness skills, and discontinuation of ADM. The mADM arm involved maintenance on a therapeutic ADM dose for the duration of follow-up. Interviewer-administered outcome measures assessed depressive symptoms and relapse/recurrence across 15-month follow-up. Mindfulness and self-compassion were measured using self-report questionnaire. Cognitive reactivity was operationalized as change in depressive thinking during a laboratory mood induction. MBCT's effects were mediated by enhancement of mindfulness and self-compassion across treatment. MBCT also changed the nature of the relationship between post-treatment cognitive reactivity and outcome. Greater reactivity predicted worse outcome for mADM participants but this relationship was not evident in the MBCT group.MBCT's treatment effects are mediated by augmented self-compassion and mindfulness, along with a decoupling of the relationship between reactivity of depressive thinking and poor outcome. This decoupling is associated with the cultivation of self-compassion across treatment. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, despite growing research on the economic lives of lesbians and gay men in the United States since the mid 1990s, very little is known about poverty in same-sex couple households. This study uses American Community Survey data from 2010 to 2014 to calculate poverty rates for households headed by different-sex versus same-sex couples. Comparing households with similar characteristics, the results show that those headed by same-sex couples are more likely to be in poverty than those headed by different-sex married couples. Despite that overall disadvantage, a decomposition of the poverty risk shows that same-sex couples are protected from poverty by their higher levels of education and labor force participation, and their lower probability of having a child in the home. Lastly, the role of gender–above and beyond sexual orientation–is clear in the greater vulnerability to poverty for lesbian couples.},

This paper explores the use of college proximity as an exogenous determinant of schooling. Analysis of the NLS Young Men Cohort reveals that men who grew up in local labor markets with a nearby college have significantly higher education and earnings than other men. The education and earnings gains are concentrated among men with poorly-educated parents - men who would otherwise stop schooling at relatively low levels. When college proximity is taken as an exogenous determinant of schooling the implied instrumental variables estimates of the return to schooling are 25-60{\%} higher than conventional ordinary least squares estimates. Since the effect of a nearby college on schooling attainment varies by family background it is possible to test whether college proximity is a legitimately exogenous determinant of schooling. The results affirm that marginal returns to education among children of less-educated parents are as high and perhaps much higher than the rates of return estimated by conventional methods.},

We find robust evidence that one wrongful-discharge doctrine, the implied-contract exception, reduced state employment rates by 0.8{\%} to 1.7{\%}. The initial impact is largest for female and less-educated workers (those who change jobs frequently), while the longer-term effect is greater for older and more-educated workers (those most likely to litigate). By contrast, we find no robust employment or wage effects of two other widely recognized wrongful-discharge laws: the public-policy and good-faith exceptions. {\textcopyright} 2006 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Current measures of access to care have intrinsic limitations and may not accurately reflect the capacity of the primary care system to absorb new patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To assess primary care appointment availability by state and insurance status.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a simulated patient study. Trained field staff, randomly assigned to private insurance, Medicaid, or uninsured, called primary care offices requesting the first available appointment for either routine care or an urgent health concern. The study included a stratified random sample of primary care practices treating nonelderly adults within each of 10 states (Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Texas), selected for diversity along numerous dimensions. Collectively, these states comprise almost one-third of the US nonelderly, Medicaid, and currently uninsured populations. Sampling was based on enrollment by insurance type by county. Analyses were weighted to obtain population-based estimates for each state.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The ability to schedule an appointment and number of days to the appointment. We also examined cost and payment required at the visit for the uninsured.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Between November 13, 2012, and April 4, 2013, we made 12,907 calls to 7788 primary care practices requesting new patient appointments. Across the 10 states, 84.7{\%} (95{\%} CI, 82.6{\%}-86.8{\%}) of privately insured and 57.9{\%} (95{\%} CI, 54.8{\%}-61.0{\%}) of Medicaid callers received an appointment. Appointment rates were 78.8{\%} (95{\%} CI, 75.6{\%}-82.0{\%}) for uninsured patients with full cash payment but only 15.4{\%} (95{\%} CI, 13.2{\%}-17.6{\%}) if payment required at the time of the visit was restricted to {\$}75 or less. Conditional on getting an appointment, median wait times were typically less than 1 week (2 weeks in Massachusetts), with no differences by insurance status or urgency of health concern.\backslashn\backslashnCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although most primary care physicians are accepting new patients, access varies widely across states and insurance status. Navigator programs are needed, not only to help patients enroll but also to identify practices accepting new patients within each plan's network. Tracking new patient appointment availability over time can inform policies designed to strengthen primary care capacity and enhance the effectiveness of the coverage expansions with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.},

abstract = {Nearly 9 million Americans live in extreme-poverty neighborhoods, places that also tend to be racially segregated and dangerous. Yet, the effects on the well-being of residents of moving out of such communities into less distressed areas remain uncertain. Using data from Moving to Opportunity, a unique randomized housing mobility experiment, we found that moving from a high-poverty to lower-poverty neighborhood leads to long-term (10- to 15-year) improvements in adult physical and mental health and subjective well-being, despite not affecting economic self-sufficiency. A 1-standard deviation decline in neighborhood poverty (13 percentage points) increases subjective well-being by an amount equal to the gap in subjective well-being between people whose annual incomes differ by {\$}13,000--a large amount given that the average control group income is {\$}20,000. Subjective well-being is more strongly affected by changes in neighborhood economic disadvantage than racial segregation, which is important because racial segregation has been declining since 1970, but income segregation has been increasing.},

abstract = {We measure and analyze discriminatory behavior against same-sex couples trying to rent an apartment in Portugal and pay special attention to the role of religiosity. This is the first correspondence field experiment investigating discrimination against this minority group in Portugal, and the first one to highlight religion as a factor of importance. In our experiment, four type of applicants varying in gender (male and female) and modality (same and opposite sex) reply to Internet ads to express interest in renting an apartment in the metropolitan areas of Porto and Lisbon. All applicant couples are presented as married, stable and professional. The main finding is that male same-sex couples face significant discrimination: The probability of getting a positive reply is 7–8 percentage points, or 23–26 percent, lower for them compared to opposite-sex couples. Interestingly, this effect is decreasing in the religiosity of a parish, suggesting that the more religious, Catholic and religiously homogenous people residing there are (with certain qualifications), the less discrimination of male same-sex couples there is. Further results reveal that discrimination is stronger when the population is older and when the rent and the square-meter price of apartments are higher. The present study extends the literature to a southern European, Catholic setting, validates previous research documenting worse treatment of same-sex couples in the housing market and demonstrates a mitigating effect of religiosity under certain conditions.},

Gaming and non- gaming areas are compared to each other and to the U.S. as a whole. Data on fifteen measures ranging from income and poverty to employment and housing conditions indicate that, although substantial gaps remain between America's Native population and the rest of the U.S., rapid economic development is taking place among gaming and non-gaming tribes alike. • Having started the 1990s with incomes lagging far behind those for the general U.S. population, American Indians in Indian Country experienced substantial growth in income per capita. Even with this Indian population rising by more than 20{\%} between 1990 and 2000, real (inflation-adjusted) per capita Indian income rose by about one-third. For both gaming and non-gaming tribes, the overall rate of income growth substantially outstripped the 11{\%} increase in real per capita income for the U.S. as a whole. • From 1990 to 2000, family poverty rates dropped by seven percentage points or more in non-gaming areas, and by about ten percentage points in gaming areas. U.S. family poverty dropped eight-tenths of a percentage point. • Unemployment rates dropped by about two-and-a-half percentage points in non-gaming areas and by more than five percentage points in gaming areas. U.S. unemployment dropped by half a percentage point. • Housing overcrowding decreased during the decade, particularly in Indian areas without gaming. The percentage of American Indians living in homes with plumbing increased markedly in both gaming and non-gaming areas. The data compiled for this databook are available for download and analysis on the website of The Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development.},

However, another very plausible explanation for this finding is that peer effects are important in higher education but that these previous empirical efforts have simply not been "looking in the right place" to find the evidence of peer effects in this setting. Thus, while these papers have received considerable attention due to the general difficulty of finding credible exogenous variation in peer quality, they have difficulty answering the most fundamental question related to peer effects in this higher education-whether peer effects play an important role or not.

Anger about high housing prices and gentrification has led to protests. The urban wage premium appears to have disappeared for less skilled workers. The cities of the developing world are growing particularly rapidly, but in those places, the downsides of density are acute. In this essay, I review the causes of urban discontent and present a unified explanation for this unhappiness. Urban resurgence represents private sector success, and the public sector typically only catches up to urban change with a considerable lag. Moreover, as urban machines have been replaced by governments that are more accountable to empowered residents, urban governments do more to protect insiders and less to enable growth. The power of insiders can be seen in the regulatory limits on new construction and new businesses, the slow pace of school reform and the unwillingness to embrace congestion pricing.},

Domestic violence, one of the most widespread violent crimes against women, is one example of a family unit that is better explained as a noncooperative relationship. In this paper, a noncooperative model of domestic violence is presented. The comparative statics from this model predict that women's incomes and other financial support received from outside the marriage (family, welfare, shelters, divorce settlements, etc.) will decrease the level of violence in intact families because they increase the woman's threat point. Implications of the theoretical model are discussed and empirical evidence is summarized. The results from existing and new analysis provide support for the hypothesis that improved economic opportunities for women will decrease the level of violence in abusive relationships. {\textcopyright} 1997 Thr: Association for Social Economics.},

We used 3 Implicit Association Tests to measure implicit attitudes and stereotypes about race. Dependent variables were recommendations for pain management, urinary tract infections, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and asthma, measured by case vignettes. We used correlational analysis to assess associations among measures and hierarchical multiple regression to measure the interactive effect of the attitude measures and patients' race on treatment recommendations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Pediatricians' implicit (unconscious) attitudes and stereotypes were associated with treatment recommendations. The association between unconscious bias and patient's race was statistically significant for prescribing a narcotic medication for pain following surgery.

@article{Levitt1997a,
abstract = {While it is widely believed by academics, politicians, and the popu- lar press that incumbent members of Congress are rewarded by the electorate for bringing federal dollars to their district, the em- pirical evidence supporting that claim is extremely weak. One ex- planation for the failure to uncover the expected relationship be- tween federal spending and election outcomes is that incumbents who expect to have difficulty being reelected are likely to exert greater effort in obtaining federal outlays. Since it is generally im- possible to adequately measure this effort, the estimated impact of spending is biased downward because of an omitted variable bias. We address this estimation problem using instrumental variables. For each House district, we use spending outside the district but inside the state containing the district as an instrument for spend- ing in the district. Federal spending is affected by a large number of actors (e.g., governors, senators, mayors, and other House mem- bers in the state delegation), leading to positive correlations in federal spending across the House districts within states. However, federal spending outside of a district is unlikely to be strongly cor- related with the strength of that district's electoral challenge. In contrast to previous studies, we find strong evidence that federal spending benefits congressional incumbents: an additional {\$}100 per capita in spending is worth as much as 2 percent of the popular vote. The only category of federal spending that does not appear to yield electoral rewards is direct transfers to individuals.},

Landlords treated by rent control reduce rental housing supplies by 15 percent by selling to owner-occupants and redeveloping buildings. Thus, while rent control prevents displacement of incumbent renters in the short run, the lost rental housing supply likely drove up market rents in the long run, ultimately undermining the goals of the law.},

This article uses data from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (N = 2,647) to investigate the relationship between multiple disadvantaged statuses and health, and whether multiple forms of interpersonal discrimination contribute to this association. The results suggest that multiply disadvantaged adults are more likely to experience major depression, poor physical health, and functional limitations than their singly disadvantaged and privileged counterparts. Further, multiple forms of discrimination partially mediate the relationship between multiple stigmatized statuses and health. Taken together, these findings suggest that multiply disadvantaged adults do face a "double disadvantage" in health, in part, because of their disproportionate exposure to discrimination.},

abstract = {Racial disparities in pain treatment pose a significant public health and scientific problem. Prior studies have demonstrated that clinicians and nonclinicians are less perceptive of, and suggest less treatment for, the pain of African Americans relative to European Americans. Here we investigate the effects of explicit/implicit patient race presentation, patient race, and perceiver race on pain perception and response. African American and European American participants rated pain perception, empathy, helping motivation, and treatment suggestion in response to vignettes about patients' pain. Vignettes were accompanied by a rapid (implicit) or static (explicit) presentation of an African or European American patient's face. Participants perceived and responded more to European American patients in the implicit prime condition, when the effect of patient race was below the level of conscious regulation. This effect was reversed when patient race was presented explicitly. Additionally, female participants perceived and responded more to the pain of all patients, relative to male participants, and in the implicit prime condition, African American participants were more perceptive and responsive than European Americans to the pain of all patients. Taken together, these results suggest that known disparities in pain treatment may be largely due to automatic (below the level of conscious regulation) rather than deliberate (subject to conscious regulation) biases. These biases were not associated with traditional implicit measures of racial attitudes, suggesting that biases in pain perception and response may be independent of general prejudice. Perspective Results suggest that racial biases in pain perception and treatment are at least partially due to automatic processes. When the relevance of patient race is made explicit, however, biases are attenuated and even reversed. We also find preliminary evidence that African Americans may be more sensitive to the pain of others than are European Americans. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the American Pain Society.},

The procedure uses a wild bootstrap from a second-order local polynomial to estimate the bias of the local linear RD estimator; the bias is then subtracted from the original estimator. The bias-corrected estimator is then bootstrapped itself to generate valid confidence intervals (CIs). The CIs generated by this procedure are valid under conditions similar to Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik's (2014) analytical correction - that is, when the bias of the naive RD estimator would otherwise prevent valid inference. This chapter also provides simulation evidence that our method is as accurate as the analytical corrections and we demonstrate its use through a reanalysis of Ludwig and Miller's (2007) Head Start dataset.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of accounting for model uncertainty in linear regression models. Conditioning on a single selected model ignores model uncertainty, and thus leads to the underestimation of uncertainty when making inferences about quantities of interest. A Bayesian solution to this problem involves averaging over all possible models (i.e., combinations of predictors) when making inferences about quantities of interest. This approach is often not practical. In this article we offer two alternative approaches. First, we describe an ad hoc procedure, `'Occam's window,'' which indicates a small Set of models over which a model average can be computed. Second, we describe a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach that directly approximates the exact solution. In the presence of model uncertainty, both of these model averaging procedures provide better predictive performance than,any;single model that might reasonably have been selected. In the extreme case where there are many candidate predictors but no relationship between any of them and the response, standard variable selection procedures often choose some subset of variables that yields a high R(2) and a highly significant overall F value. In this situation, Occam's window usually indicates the null model (or a small number of models including the null model) as the only one (or ones) to be considered thus largely resolving the problem of selecting significant models when there is no signal in the data. Software to implement our methods is available from StatLib.},

However, beyond self-identification, these outcomes may vary depending on whether racial/ethnic minorities are perceived by others as being minority or white; this perception is referred to as socially-assigned race.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPURPOSE: To examine the associations between socially-assigned race and healthcare discrimination and receipt of selected preventive services.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of the 2004 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System "Reactions to Race" module. Respondents from seven states and the District of Columbia were categorized into 3 groups, defined by a composite of self-identified race/socially-assigned race: Minority/Minority (M/M, n = 6,837), Minority/White (M/W, n = 929), and White/White (W/W, n = 25,913). Respondents were 18 years or older, with 61.7{\%} under age 60; 51.8{\%} of respondents were female. Measures included reported healthcare discrimination and receipt of vaccinations and cancer screenings.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Racial/ethnic minorities who reported being socially-assigned as minority (M/M) were more likely to report healthcare discrimination compared with those who reported being socially-assigned as white (M/W) (8.9{\%} vs. 5.0{\%}, p = 0.002). Those reporting being socially-assigned as white (M/W and W/W) had similar rates for past-year influenza (73.1{\%} vs. 74.3{\%}) and pneumococcal (69.3{\%} vs. 58.6{\%}) vaccinations; however, rates were significantly lower among M/M respondents (56.2{\%} and 47.6{\%}, respectively, p-values{\textless}0.05). There were no significant differences between the M/M and M/W groups in the receipt of cancer screenings.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Racial/ethnic minorities who reported being socially-assigned as white are more likely to receive preventive vaccinations and less likely to report healthcare discrimination compared with those who are socially-assigned as minority. Socially-assigned race/ethnicity is emerging as an important area for further research in understanding how race/ethnicity influences health outcomes.},

Racial minorities and women are known to receive disproportionately poorer quality of health care when compared to non-Hispanic Whites. It is unknown why women and particular racial and ethnic minorities are more susceptible to experience disparities in patient care. Moreover, with pain being the most common complaint for those entering the healthcare system, gaps in understanding the potential relationship between the nurse provider's gender and/or race and ethnicity and pain management deserve exploration. A systematic literature review has been conducted to explore the current state of knowledge related to providers, health disparities, and pain. Much of the research to date has focused on the provider-patient relationship to health disparities in pain management. Further research is needed to examine how provider-patient interactions may influence patient outcomes, satisfaction, adherence and disparities in health.},

abstract = {Racial discrimination may contribute to diminished well-being, possibly through stress and restricted economic advancement. Our study examines whether reports of racial discrimination predict health problems, and whether health problems predict the reporting of racial discrimination. Data come from years 1979 to 1983 of the US National Longitudinal Study of Youth, focusing on respondents of Black (n = 1851), Hispanic (n = 1170), White (n = 3450) and other (n = 1387) descent. Our analyses indicate that reports of racial discrimination in seeking employment predict health-related work limitations, although these limitations develop over time, and not immediately. We also find that reports of discrimination at two time-points appear more strongly related to health-related work limitations than reports at one time-point. A key finding is that these limitations do not predict the subsequent reporting of racial discrimination in seeking employment. These findings inform our knowledge of the temporal ordering of racial discrimination in seeking employment and health-related work conditions among young adults. The findings also indicate that future research should carefully attend to the patterns and timing of discrimination. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Using difference-in-difference estimation and monthly panel data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), I compare labor market attachment, non-work activity, hours worked, and earnings and wages of those in areas with early school closures and stay-in-place orders with those in areas with delayed or no pandemic closures. While there was no immediate impact on detachment or unemployment, mothers with jobs in early closure states were 68.8 percent more likely than mothers in late closure states to have a job but not be working as a result of early shutdowns. There was no effect on working fathers or working women without school age children. Mothers who continued working increased their work hours relative to comparable fathers; this effect, however, appears entirely driven by a reduction in fathers' hours worked. Overall, the pandemic appears to have induced a unique immediate juggling act for working parents of school age children. Mothers took a week of leave from formal work; fathers working fulltime, for example, reduced their hours worked by 0.53 hours over the week. While experiences were different for mothers and fathers, each are vulnerable to scarring and stunted opportunities for career growth and advancement due to the pandemic.},

Objective: To investigate the association of both the patient and the physician gender with ICU admission rate of critically ill emergency department (ED) medical patients in a hospital with restricted ICU bed capacity operates with 'closed door' policy. Methods: A retrospective population-based cohort analysis. We included patients above 18 admitted to an ED resuscitation room (RR) of a tertiary hospital during 2011-12. Data on medical, laboratory and clinical characteristics were obtained. We used an adjusted multivariable logistic regression to analyze the association between both the patient and the physician gender to the ICU admission decision. Results: We included 831 RR admissions, 388 (46.7{\%}) were female patients and 188 (22.6{\%}) were treated by a female physicians. In adjusted multivariable analysis (adjusted for age, diabetes, mode of hospital transportation, first pH and patients who were treated with definitive airway and vasso-pressors in the RR), female-female combination (patient-physician, respectively) showed the lowest likelihood to be admitted to ICU (adjusted OR: 0.21; 95{\%} CI: 0.09-0.51) compared to male-male combination, in addition to a smaller decrease among female-male (adjusted OR: 0.53; 95{\%} CI: 0.32-0.86) and male-female (adjusted OR: 0.43; 95{\%} CI: 0.21-0.89) combinations. Conclusion: We demonstrated the existence of the possible gender bias where female gender of the patient and treating physician diminish the likelihood of the restricted health resource use.},

abstract = {Governments employ police to prevent criminal acts. But it remains in dispute whether high rates of police stops, criminal summonses and aggressive low-level arrests reduce serious crime 1-7 . Police officers target their efforts at areas where crime is anticipated and/or where they expect enforcement will be most effective. Simultaneously, citizens decide to comply with the law or commit crime partly on the basis of police deployment and enforcement strategies. In other words, policing and crime are endogenous to unobservable strategic interaction, which frustrates causal analysis. Here, we resolve these challenges and present evidence that proactive policing - which involves systematic and aggressive enforcement of low-level violations - is positively related to reports of major crime. We examine a political shock that caused the New York Police Department (NYPD) to effectively halt proactive policing in late 2014 and early 2015. Analysing several years of unique data obtained from the NYPD, we find that civilian complaints of major crimes (such as burglary, felony assault and grand larceny) decreased during and shortly after sharp reductions in proactive policing. The results challenge prevailing scholarship as well as conventional wisdom on authority and legal compliance, as they imply that aggressively enforcing minor legal statutes incites more severe criminal acts.},

abstract = {Audit and correspondence studies are established as the dominant empirical strategy for examining the prevalence of hiring discrimination in labor markets. Historically, these studies are most often conducted as pairwise within-subject tests where one of the testers or applicants are exposed to the treatment of interest, while the other serves as a reference. In more recent studies, however, some scholars are moving towards the practice of sending only a single application per vacancy. This design choice is rarely discussed explicitly. Taking experiments on ethnic hiring discrimination as a case, I summarize the strengths, weaknesses and particular considerations associated with both approaches, by aid of a computational model comparing the two. The main argument I present is that the matched and unmatched designs differ in a more substantive way than what has been properly acknowledged in previous studies: Choice of design can potentially influence estimates, as the matched design induces competition affecting the callback probability of the treated candidates when applicant pools are small. I conclude that this is a potential weakness of the matched design, but that each design has multiple distinct advantages. While this study discusses experiments on hiring discrimination specifically, the main argument applies to similar contexts where one has to choose between matched and unmatched designs.},

Previous reforms in the Netherlands have encouraged labour supply and are expected to boost labour-market participation of individuals aged 55 to 64 to 60{\%} in 2020. Further stimulus of supply is debatable due to perverse distributive implications. The increase in participation reveals inefficiencies in the demand side of the market. Indeed, the Dutch labour market for elderly is characterised by long unemployment duration, long job tenures, low mobility and little investment in human capital. The inefficiencies were previously hidden by massive early retirement, but will become more pressing as the workforce ages and participation rates increase. This imposes a new challenge for Dutch policy, a challenge that has become more urgent due to the current financial crisis that is expected to cause a substantial rise in unemployment.

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of in-school GBV on rates of suicide attempts among transgender people. Of the 290 respondents, 44.8{\%} reported they had experienced in-school GBV, and 28.5{\%} reported a history of suicide attempt. Among those who had attempted, 32.5{\%} reported having made one attempt, 28.6{\%} reported a history of two attempts, and 39.0{\%} reported having made three or more attempts. Participants who reported experiencing GBV were approximately four times more likely to have attempted suicide than those who did not. Among the subgroups of 147 trans women and 81 trans men, GBV was associated both with history of suicide attempt, and with a higher number of suicide attempts over the life span. Implications for policy and clinical interventions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

abstract = {In order to extend the literature on consensual nonmonogamy, we conducted two studies that examined public awareness and perceptions of polyamory. Specifically, we identified individual differences that predict people's attitudes towards polyamory and also explored whether manipulations grounded in prejudice-reduction theory might lead to more positive perceptions. In both studies, individuals reporting more traditional traits (e.g. political conservatism and religiosity) had more negative attitudes towards polyamory. In addition, participants' prior exposure to polyamory (i.e. familiarity with the term polyamory or knowing someone polyamorous) was positively related to attitudes towards polyamory, consistent with Allport's contact hypothesis. Finally, an experimental manipulation revealed that participants who either received additional information about polyamory (consistent with the notion that increased knowledge about outgroups can reduce prejudice; Pettigrew {\&} Tropp) or were asked to consider the advantages and limitations of monogamy (consistent with value self-confrontation theory; Rokeach) exhibited more positive attitudes towards polyamory than did participants who only received a standard definition of polyamory. As our results represent some of the first empirical findings on perceptions of polyamory, implications for addressing the stigmatisation of this relationship style are discussed.},

abstract = {The present study aimed at identifying the attitude-related barriers that older unemployed, jobseeking workers (50+) face when they endeavor to reenter the labor market and to investigate employers' attitudes and perceptions of older workers. Two studies were conducted. In study 1, interviews were undertaken with 26 unemployed persons and 24 representatives of other stakeholders, including social partners and officials representing the Social Insurance Agency (FK) and the Public Employment Service (AF). In study 2, the attitudes among private sector employers were studied by carrying out a questionnaire survey (N = 147). The interview results showed that many unemployed job seekers had experienced negative age-related attitudes among employers. This observation was supported by other stakeholders. Perceived attitudes to older workers and lack of updated competence were considered crucial. The questionnaire study showed a mixed picture concerning employer attitudes. There was a statistical difference between older ({\textgreater}50 years) and younger employers; older employers believed that older women wanted competence development to a greater extent. There was also a significant difference between female and male employers' opinions; female employers, in particular the older ones, assessed that older women wished competence development to a greater extent. These differences were not found with respect to views on older men. About half (52{\%}) of the employers had the opinion that there was no difference between older and younger employees with respect to the ability to cope with changes or learning new things. However, younger female employers (but not older female employers) considered that older employees had greater difficulties with changes or learning new things. It is concluded that negative attitudes to older workers with respect to competence development tend to be most common among younger employers.},

abstract = {In this article, we respond at length to recent critiques of research on implicit bias, especially studies using the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Tetlock and Mitchell (2009) claim that "there is no evidence that the IAT reliably predicts class-wide discrimination on tangible outcomes in any setting," accuse their colleagues of violating "the injunction to separate factual from value judgments," adhering blindly to a "statist interventionist" ideology, and of conducting a witch-hunt against implicit racists, sexists, and others. These and other charges are specious. Far from making "extraordinary claims" that "require extraordinary evidence," researchers have identified the existence and consequences of implicit bias through well-established methods based upon principles of cognitive psychology that have been developed in nearly a century's worth of work. We challenge the blanket skepticism and organizational complacency advocated by Tetlock and Mitchell and summarize 10 recent studies that no manager (or managerial researcher) should ignore. These studies reveal that students, nurses, doctors, police officers, employment recruiters, and many others exhibit implicit biases with respect to race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, social status, and other distinctions. Furthermore-and contrary to the emphatic assertions of the critics-participants' implicit associations do predict socially and organizationally significant behaviors, including employment, medical, and voting decisions made by working adults. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Since explicit-wage ads often target unskilled workers, other estimates in the literature ignoring hidden-wage ads may suffer from selection bias. Moreover, job ad requirements are aligned with their applicants' traits, as predicted in directed search models with heterogeneity.},

This study utilized data collected from the Virginia Transgender Health Initiative Survey (THIS) of transgender people (individuals who described their gender identity as different from their assigned sex at birth) collected from 2005-2006. Current study analyses were limited to two subgroups: trans women (n = 179) and trans men (n = 92). We hypothesized that, as in the general population, exposure to physical and sexual violence would be related to suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and substance abuse. Both trans women and trans men in this sample were at high risk for physical and sexual violence, as well as suicidal ideation and suicide attempt. Logistic regression analyses indicated that among both trans women and trans men, those who had endured physical and/or sexual violence were significantly more likely than those who had not had such experiences to report a history of suicide attempt and multiple suicide attempts. In addition, among trans men, history of physical and sexual violence were each related to alcohol abuse. Among trans women, history of sexual violence was related to alcohol abuse and illicit substance abuse. Patterns of violence against transgender people were identified and are discussed, including frequent gender-related motivation for violence, low prevalance of reporting violence to the police, and variety of perpetrators of violence. Clinical implications and recommendations are useful.},

The two applicants differ with respect to characteristics such as gender, age, education, experience, ethnicity, religious beliefs, family situation, weight, and health. Our results show that employers discriminate against applicants who are old, non-European, Muslim, Jewish, obese, have several children, or have a history of sickness absence. Moreover, increasing the firms' cost of uncertainty in hiring – through more firm co-payment in the sickness benefit system – may reduce hiring, but does not affect the degree of discrimination. Also, there are only small differences in the degree of discrimination between different types of recruiters and firms. Overall, our results suggest that the discrimination, at least partially, should reflect statistical discrimination.},

The WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was used to assess lifetime DSM-IV anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders. Ages of onset for individual disorders and ages of first treatment contact for each disorder were used to calculate the extent of failure and delay in initial help seeking. The proportion of lifetime cases making treatment contact in the year of disorder onset ranged from 0.8 to 36.4{\%} for anxiety disorders, from 6.0 to 52.1{\%} for mood disorders, and from 0.9 to 18.6{\%} for substance use disorders. By 50 years, the proportion of lifetime cases making treatment contact ranged from 15.2 to 95.0{\%} for anxiety disorders, from 7.9 to 98.6{\%} for mood disorders, and from 19.8 to 86.1{\%} for substance use disorders. Median delays among cases eventually making contact ranged from 3.0 to 30.0 years for anxiety disorders, from 1.0 to 14.0 years for mood disorders, and from 6.0 to 18.0 years for substance use disorders. Failure and delays in treatment seeking were generally greater in developing countries, older cohorts, men, and cases with earlier ages of onset. These results show that failure and delays in initial help seeking are pervasive problems worldwide. Interventions to ensure prompt initial treatment contacts are needed to reduce the global burdens and hazards of untreated mental disorders.},

abstract = {It is a standard practice in regression analyses to allow for clustering in the error covariance matrix if the explanatory variable of interest varies at a more aggregate level (e.g., the state level) than the units of observation (e.g., individuals). Often, however, the structure of the error covariance matrix is more complex, with correlations not vanishing for units in different clusters. Here, we explore the implications of such correlations for the actual and estimated precision of least squares estimators. Our main theoretical result is that with equal-sized clusters, if the covariate of interest is randomly assigned at the cluster level, only accounting for nonzero covariances at the cluster level, and ignoring correlations between clusters as well as differences in within-cluster correlations, leads to valid confidence intervals. However, in the absence of random assignment of the covariates, ignoring general correlation structures may lead to biases in standard errors. We illustrate our findings ...},

abstract = {We explore the decline in teen employment in the United States since 2000, which was sharpest for 16–17 year-olds. We consider three main explanatory factors: a rising minimum wage that could reduce employment opportunities for teens and potentially increase the value of investing in schooling; rising returns to schooling; and increasing competition from immigrants that, like the minimum wage, could reduce employment opportunities and possibly also raise the returns to human capital investment. We find that, among these factors, higher minimum wages are the predominant factor explaining changes in the schooling and workforce behavior of 16–17 year-olds since 2000. The employment decline arises from a combination of a lower likelihood of being both employed and enrolled in school, and a higher likelihood of being enrolled in school only (not employed). These effects are consistent with the minimum wage leading students to increase their focus on schooling to meet a higher productivity standard for jobs with a higher minimum wage.},

abstract = {The choice of electoral system is one of the most important institutional decisions for any democracy. In almost all cases the choice of a particular electoral system has a profound effect on the future political life of the country concerned, and electoral systems, once chosen, often remain fairly constant as political interests solidify around and respond to the incentives presented by them. The choices that are made may have consequences that were unforeseen as well as predicted effects. Electoral system choice is a fundamentally political process, rather than a question to which independent technical experts can produce a single correct answer. The consideration of political advantage is almost always a factor in the choice of electoral systems. Calculations of short-term political interest can often obscure the longer-term consequences of a particular electoral system. The choice of electoral system can have a significant impact on the wider political and institutional framework: it is important not to see electoral systems in isolation. Their design and effects are heavily contingent upon other structures within and outside the constitution. Successful electoral system design comes from looking at the framework of political institutions as a whole: changing one part of this framework is likely to cause adjustments in the way other institutions within it work. Electoral systems are today viewed as one of the most influential of all political institutions, and of crucial importance to broader issues of governance. For example, it is increasingly being recognized that an electoral system can be designed both to provide local geographic representation and to promote proportionality; can promote the development of strong and viable national political parties, and ensure the representation of women and regional minorities; and can help to engineer cooperation and accommodation in a divided society by the creative use of particular incentives and constraints.},

Analysis of covariance adjusted for possible explanatory factors. Results. Women were more likely to report limitations, use of assistance, and a greater degree of disability, particularly among IADL categories. However, these gender differences were largely explained by differences in disability-related health conditions. Conclusions. Greater prevalence of nonfatal disabling conditions, including fractures, osteoporosis, back problems, osteoarthritis and depression, contributes substantially to greater disability and diminished quality of life among aging women compared with men.},

abstract = {Forty decades of sociological stress research offer five major findings. First, when stressors (negative events, chronic strains, and traumas) are measured comprehensively, their damaging impacts on physical and mental health are substantial. Second, differential exposure to stressful experiences is a primary way that gender, racial-ethnic, marital status, and social class inequalities in physical and mental health are produced. Third, minority group members are additionally harmed by discrimination stress. Fourth, stressors proliferate over the life course and across generations, widening health gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged group members. Fifth, the impacts of stressors on health and well-being are reduced when persons have high levels of mastery, self-esteem, and/or social support. With respect to policy, to help individuals cope with adversity, tried and true coping and support interventions should be more widely disseminated and employed. To address health inequalities, the structural conditions that put people at risk of stressors should be a focus of programs and policies at macro and meso levels of intervention. Programs and policies also should target children who are at lifetime risk of ill health and distress due to exposure to poverty and stressful family circumstances.},

abstract = {Panel data are often used in empirical work to account for additive fixed time and unit effects. More recently, the synthetic control estimator relaxes the assumption of additive fixed effects for case studies, using pretreatment outcomes to create a weighted average of other units which best approximate the treated unit. The synthetic control estimator is currently limited to case studies in which the treatment variable can be represented by a single indicator variable. Applying this estimator more generally, such as applications with multiple treatment variables or a continuous treatment variable, is problematic. This paper generalizes the case study synthetic control estimator to permit estimation of the effect of multiple treatment variables, which can be discrete or continuous. The estimator jointly estimates the impact of the treatment variables and creates a synthetic control for each unit. Additive fixed effect models are a special case of this estimator. Because the number of units in panel data and synthetic control applications is often small, I discuss an inference procedure for fixed N. The estimation technique generates correlations across clusters so the inference procedure will also account for this dependence. Simulations show that the estimator works well even when additive fixed effect models do not. I estimate the impact of the minimum wage on the employment rate of teenagers. I estimate an elasticity of -0.44, substantially larger than estimates generated using additive fixed effect models, and reject the null hypothesis that there is no effect.},

abstract = {Using a random judge design and panel data from Norway, we esti- mate that imprisonment discourages further criminal behavior, with reoffense probabilities falling by 29 percentage points and criminal charges dropping by 11 over a 5-year period. Ordinary least squares mistakenly reaches the opposite conclusion. The decline is driven by individuals not working prior to incarceration; these individuals increase participation in employment programs and raise their future employment and earnings. Previously employed individuals experi- ence lasting negative employment effects. These findings demonstrate that time spent in prison with a focus on rehabilitation can be preventive for a large segment of criminal population.},

abstract = {The 2014 Medicaid expansion revised Medicaid eligibility provisions to allow for low-income, nonelderly adults to be eligible for Medicaid on those states which opt for this change. During the first two years after the expansion, there were more than 10.7 million newly eligible Medicaid enrollees nationwide. I investigate the short-term impact the 2014 Medicaid expansion had on Medicaid spending by the government. Using data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on all Medicaid expenditures over a seventeen year period. I apply a difference-in-differences design to exploit the variation among states electing to participate in the expansion and the health care services they offer. These data allow me to study the economic impact of the expansion on all possible health care services. Among the 21 services assessed, I find that after the expansion became effective, five services utilized by the target population for the reform experienced a statistically significant increase in average Medicaid spending: dental services (211 percent), clinic services (101 percent), outpatient hospital services (77 percent), physician and surgical services (35 percent), and inpatient hospital services (17 percent). This implies that the new adult group may be healthier and seeking more routine or preventive care compared to the traditional Medicaid population. The increase in routine and preventive care has the potential to result in better health outcomes and fewer medical emergencies in the future, ultimately lowering Medicaid spending by the state and federal government over the long term.},

The author derives instruments from the natural boundaries in a metropolitan area. The author's results suggest that metropolitan areas with greater Tiebout choice have more productive public schools and less private schooling. Little of the effect of Tiebout choice works through its effect on household sorting. This finding may be explained by another finding: students are equally segregated by school in metropolitan areas with greater and lesser degrees of Tiebout choice among districts.

A prevalent research focus on urban LGBT populations has created a gap in understanding rural LGBT health care and outcomes from a holistic perspective. The present article provides a literature review focusing on the health and health care experiences of LGBT people living in rural areas and highlighting challenges and opportunities for growth in providing culturally competent rural health care. We conducted a systematic review that resulted in the inclusion of 58 articles focused on the health of rural LGBTQ people published between 1998 and February 2016. Findings clustered around 3 themes: (1) individual health outcomes and risk behaviors, (2) experiences of health care and interactions with the health care system, and (3) sociocultural factors at the intersection of rurality and health. Evidence-based recommendations for systemic change and interventions to promote health among rural LGBT people are provided.

We then modify two popular indexes so that they measure deviations from random allocation rather than deviations from evenness. An empirical example suggests that these modified indexes provide improved measures of the systematic component of group segregation.},

While almost two-thirds of the gap in homeownership between married and same-sex couples can be explained by differences in characteristics, about one-third of the gap can be attributed to differences in behavior and treatment, including discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and marital status. About half of the gap between unmarried opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples can be explained by differences in characteristics, with the remaining half attributable to differences in behavior and treatment.},

abstract = {Background: Swedish research concerning the general health of trans people is scarce. Despite the diversity of the group, most Swedish research has focused on gender dysphoric people seeking medical help for their gender incongruence, or on outcomes after medical gender-confirming interventions. This paper examines self-rated health, self-reported disability and quality of life among a diverse group of trans people including trans feminine, trans masculine, and gender nonbinary people (identifying with a gender in between male of female, or identify with neither of these genders) as well as people self-identifying as transvestites. Methods: Participants were self-selected anonymously to a web-based survey conducted in 2014. Univariable and multivariable regression analyses were performed. Three backward selection regression models were conducted in order to identify significant variables for the outcomes self-rated health, self-reported disability and quality of life. Results: Study participants included 796 individuals, between 15 and 94 years of age who live in Sweden. Respondents represented a heterogeneous group with regards to trans experience, with the majority being gender nonbinary (44 {\%}), followed by trans masculine (24 {\%}), trans feminine (19 {\%}) and transvestites (14 {\%}). A fifth of the respondents reported poor self-rated health, 53 {\%} reported a disability and 44 {\%} reported quality of life scores below the median cut-off value of 6 (out of 10). Nonbinary gender identity (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 2.19; 95 {\%} CI: 1.24, 3.84), negative health care experiences (aOR = 1.92; 95 {\%} CI: 1.26, 2.91) and not accessing legal gender recognition (aOR = 3.06; 95 {\%} CI: 1.64, 5.72) were significant predictors for self-rated health. Being gender nonbinary (aOR = 2.18; 95 {\%} CI: 1.35, 3.54) and history of negative health care experiences (aOR = 2.33; 95 {\%} CI: 1.54, 3.52) were, in addition, associated with self-reported disability. Lastly, not accessing legal gender recognition (aOR = 0.32; 95 {\%} CI: 0.17, 0.61) and history of negative health care experiences (aOR = 0.56; 95 {\%} CI: 0.36, 0.88) were associated with lower quality of life. Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that the general health of trans respondents is related to vulnerabilities that are unique for trans people in addition to other well-known health determinants.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The recent Institute of Medicine Report assessing the state of pain care in the United States acknowledged the lack of consistent data to describe the nature and magnitude of unrelieved pain and identify subpopulations with disproportionate burdens.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES:We synthesized 20 years of cumulative evidence on racial/ethnic disparities in analgesic treatment for pain in the United States. Evidence was examined for the 1) magnitude of association between race/ethnicity and analgesic treatment; 2) subgroups at an increased risk; and 3) the effect of moderators (pain type, setting, study quality, and data collection period) on this association.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS:United States studies with at least one explicit aim or analysis comparing analgesic treatment for pain between Whites and a minority group were included (SciVerse Scopus database, 1989-2011).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS:Blacks/African Americans experienced both a higher number and magnitude of disparities than any other group in the analyses. Opioid treatment disparities were ameliorated for Hispanics/Latinos for "traumatic/surgical" pain (P = 0.293) but remained for "non-traumatic/nonsurgical" pain (odds ratio [OR] = 0.70, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 0.64-0.77, P = 0.000). For Blacks/African Americans, opioid prescription disparities were present for both types of pain and were starker for "non-traumatic/nonsurgical" pain (OR = 0.66, 95{\%} CI = 0.59-0.75, P = 0.000). In subanalyses, opioid treatment disparities for Blacks/African Americans remained consistent across pain types, settings, study quality, and data collection periods.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION:Our study quantifies the magnitude of analgesic treatment disparities in subgroups of minorities. The size of the difference was sufficiently large to raise not only normative but quality and safety concerns. The treatment gap does not appear to be closing with time or existing policy initiatives. A concerted strategy is needed to reduce pain care disparities within the larger quality of care initiatives.},

abstract = {Laboratory experiments in psychology find that media violence increases aggression in the short run. We analyze whether media violence affects violent crime in the field. We exploit variation in the violence of blockbuster movies from 1995 to 2004, and study the effect on same-day assaults. We find that violent crime decreases on days with larger theater audiences for violent movies. The effect is partly due to voluntary incapacitation: between 6 p.m. and 12 a.m., a one million increase in the audience for violent movies reduces violent crime by 1.1{\%} to 1.3{\%}. After exposure to the movie, between 12 a.m. and 6 a.m., violent crime is reduced by an even larger percent. This finding is explained by the self-selection of violent individuals into violent movie attendance, leading to a substitution away from more volatile activities. In particular, movie attendance appears to reduce alcohol consumption. The results emphasize that media exposure affects behavior not only via content, but also because it changes time spent in alternative activities. The substitution away from more dangerous activities in the field can explain the differences with the laboratory findings. Our estimates suggest that in the short run, violent movies deter almost 1,000 assaults on an average weekend. Although our design does not allow us to estimate long-run effects, we find no evidence of medium-run effects up to three weeks after initial exposure.},

abstract = {Transformations that could be used to reduce the influence of extreme observations of dependent variables, which can assume either sign, on regression coefficient estimates are studied in this article. Two that seem reasonable on a priori grounds--the extended Box-Cox (BC) and the inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS)--are evaluated in detail. One feature is that the log-likelihood function for IHS is defined for zero values of the dependent variable, which is not true of BC. The double-length regression technique (Davidson and MacKinnon 1984) is used to perform hypothesis tests of one transformation against the other using Canadian data on household net worth. These tests support the use of IHS instead of BC for this data set. Empirical investigators in economics often work with a logged dependent variable (taking the natural logarithm of a data series is, of course, a special case of BC) to reduce the weight their particular estimation procedure might otherwise attach to extreme values of the dependent variable. Logging dependent and independent variables has the added attraction that slope coefficients may be interpreted as elasticities. In the event that the dependent variable assumes nonpositive values, some researchers (e.g., Diamond and Hausman 1984; King and Dicks-Mireaux 1982) have dropped the nonpositive values and others have added a constant so that each observation is positive. An alternative transformation, which is defined for any real number, is the IHS transformation, {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}{\$}\backslashoperatorname{\{}sinh{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}(x) = \backslashlog(x + (x{\^{}}2 + 1){\^{}}{\{}1/2{\}}){\$}{\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater}. This was proposed in Johnson (1949) and is just as easy to employ as the BC transformation.},

A recent and growing body of evidence suggests that LGB individuals also suffer physical health disparities relative to heterosexuals, ranging from poor general health status to increased risk for cancer and heightened diagnoses of cardiovascular disease, asthma, diabetes, and other chronic conditions. Despite recent advances in this literature, the causes of LGB physical health problems remain relatively opaque. In this article, we review empirical findings related to LGB physical health disparities and argue that such disparities are related to the experience of minority stress-that is, stress caused by experiences with antigay stigma. In light of this minority stress model, we highlight gaps in the current literature and outline five research steps necessary for developing a comprehensive knowledge of the social determinants of LGB physical health.},

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine common stereotypes regarding old-age workers and the effect of these stereotypes on organizational productivity, as well as to suggest practical solutions for accommodating old-age workers and increasing productivity in all employees. Design/methodology/approach – This three part paper will present a thorough review of relevant literature (1991-2014, with the exception of two studies from 1976) that were conducted on the topics of old-age stereotyping, the effect of old-age stereotyping on organizational productivity, and methods for adequately motivating and managing old-age workers. Studies concerning psychology theories are also examined in order to provide a framework for practical solutions, as well as demographic statistics on population age and employment trends. Findings – This paper identifies a number of old-age stereotypes that have decreased organizational productivity in empirical studies, including reluctance to change, decreased learning ability, intelligence and memory, poor health and accidents, higher organizational costs, decreased motivation, and low innovation and productivity. Findings also suggest that old-age workers can positively affect productivity, and that low productivity is often a result of stereotyping. Research limitations/implications – The prevalence of old-age stereotyping and its impact on organizational productivity may differ by culture, industry, type of employment, education level, and other factors, and thus further research may be necessary. The literature reviewed may not adequately represent worldwide organizational trends, as the literature is largely comprised of studies performed in North America and Europe. Practical implications – Solutions based on these findings are taken directly from the literature or derived from literature on psychology theories, which include self-determination theory, socio-emotional selectivity theory, and selective optimization and compensation theory. The practical solutions proposed address work environment, motivation, rewards, flexibility, and the loss and gain of resources in old-age workers. Social implications – The proportion of old-age workers is increasing and it is therefore necessary to determine ways to adequately integrate old-age workers in the workforce. Furthermore, this can raise productivity in all employees. Originality/value – This paper demonstrates that old-age stereotyping is both prevalent and detrimental within an organizational context. These findings and solutions can potentially be used by organizations in order to increase individual and overall productivity.},

Recent work has investigated whether there are variations from the "mean" return to education across the population with mixed results. We use an instrumental variables estimator for quantile regression on a sample of twins to estimate an entire family of returns to education at different quantiles of the conditional distribution of wages while addressing simultaneity and measurement error biases. We test whether there is individual heterogeneity in returns to education and find that: more able individuals obtain more schooling perhaps due to lower marginal costs and/or higher marginal benefits of schooling and that higher ability individuals (those further to the right in the conditional distribution of wages) have higher returns to schooling consistent with a non-trivial interaction between schooling and unobserved abilities in the generation of earnings. The estimated returns are never lower than 9 percent and can be as high as 13 percent at the top of the conditional distribution of wages but they vary significantly only along the [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Thereof, 373 received treatment consisting of amoxicillin, clarithromycin and PPI (AC/PPI). Availability of PCR-based clarithromycin susceptibility test results from pre-treatment gastric biopsies was a pre-condition for matching 52 aiHp to 52 non-aiHp cases within the AC/PPI-group. Results: AiHp were detected mostly in low counts predominantly in corpus, rarely in antrum biopsies (95.2{\%} vs. 24.6{\%}); they were found in 497 (61{\%}) of all patients and in 192 of 373 patients (51.5{\%}) in the AC/PPI-group. The eradication rate in aiHp vs. non-aiHp cases was 44.4{\%} vs. 72.9{\%} in the entire sample and 45.3{\%} vs. 66.8{\%} in the AC/PPI-group. Among the 104 paired patients, respective values were 46.2{\%} vs. 78.8{\%}; in clarithromycin susceptible cases 60.6{\%} vs. 91.9{\%}. Both aiHp and resistance to clarithromycin proved to be highly significant (p≤0.001) and independent predictors of eradication failure. Twelve of 13 aiHp cases with a clarithromycin sensitive strain, who failed eradication, developed resistance to the antibiotic. Conclusions: AiHp found by immunohistochemical staining especially in corpus biopsies proved to be a risk factor for failure of first-line triple therapies; occurrence of aiHp should be considered with regard to therapy options.},

@article{Bozani2019,
abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide empirical patterns regarding trans people's self-esteem-oriented evaluations during observations of positive workplace actions. The case of a 2015 UK workplace guide is utilized to fulfil the aims. The guide provides suggestions to employers for recruiting and retaining trans people. Design/methodology/approach: A new questionnaire is created which forms a 20-item scale capturing a variety of self-evaluations. Trans people provided their responses in a 2018–2019 survey and the study's patterns were captured. Findings: The outcomes suggest that trans people's self-esteem and self-respect are enhanced by policy makers' positive actions to promote inclusivity in the workplace. In addition, due to these actions trans people feel more accepted, valued and trusted by the government. The authors suggest that a lack of positive workplace actions may be detrimental to trans people's self-esteem. However, if a workplace policy is perceived to be a recognition of trans people's worth this may be internalized, resulting in positive self-evaluations. The authors suggest that the 2015 workplace guide aims to ensure that trans people's self-expressions are not constrained in ways that could cause them self-esteem difficulties. Practical implications: The study also finds that firms which have implemented the workplace guide have informed human resources strategies, affected corporate profiles and staff organizational behaviours, created a more inclusive workplace culture, and addressed LGBT business and trans staff members' needs. The authors suggest that when employers utilize policy makers' positive workplace policies they may be able to realize positive organizational outcomes in their firms. Social implications: The World Health Organization perceives self-esteem as a public matter and this study suggests that inclusive workplace strategies can positively affect the psychological states of a highly marginalized population group. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge this is the first attempt to quantify how a workplace guide impacts on self-esteem-oriented evaluations among trans people. Each one of the 20 items in the scale brings new insights into the subject matter.},

It argues that the date of man- datory retirement is chosen to correspond to the date of volun- tary retirement, but the nature of the optimal wage profile results in a discrepancy between spot wage and spot VMP (value of the worker's marginal product). This is because it is preferable to pay workers less than VMP when young and more than VMP when old. By doing so, the "agency" problem is solved, so the contract with mandatory retirement is Pareto efficient. A theory of agency is presented and empirical evidence which supports the hypothesis is provided. Mandatory},

Because of these costs investment is not undertaken unless it raises the level of the deferred income stream.

We start by distinguishing two purposes of estimation: to estimate population descriptive statistics and to estimate causal effects. In the former type of research, weighting is called for when it is needed to make the analysis sample representative of the target population. In the latter type, the weighting issue is more nuanced. We discuss three distinct potential motives for weighting when estimating causal effects: (1) to achieve precise estimates by correcting for heteroskedasticity; (2) to achieve consistent estimates by correcting for endogenous sampling; and (3) to identify average partial effects in the presence of unmodeled heterogeneity of effects. In each case, we find that the motive sometimes does not apply in situations where practitioners often assume it does. We recommend diagnostics for assessing the advisability of weighting, and we suggest methods for appropriate inference.},

Industries have similar clustering patterns even in very different cities. Using Bureau of Labor Statistics data, we conducted geographic information systems (GIS) analysis to compare cultural industries in Los Angeles and New York City, two cities with very different types of geography and urban environments. Two distinct findings emerged: (1) when cultural industries are disaggregated into distinct industrial subsectors (art, fashion, music, design), important differences among them emerge; and (2) cultural industries “behave” similarly in each city because their subsectors tend to colocate (e.g., art with design; music with film) in similar ways, and this coloca- tion pattern remains consistent in both locations. Such notable clustering tendencies of cultural industries help inform future research and further enlighten our understanding of their location patterns. Keywords},

More recently, researchers are beginning to explore others'$\backslash$nattitudes towards polyamory. To support future work in this area, we$\backslash$ncreated a 7-item measure of attitudes towards polyamory and validated it$\backslash$nin three samples. Sample 1 used 100US adults to create the initial$\backslash$nversion of the Attitudes Towards Polyamory (ATP) Scale. In Sample 2, the$\backslash$nresponses of 134US college students were used to revise the scale and to$\backslash$nobtain evidence for construct validity and test-retest reliability.$\backslash$nSample 3 employed 196US adults to confirm the factor structure of the$\backslash$nscale and to further establish convergent and divergent validity. As$\backslash$nexpected, participants who held more traditional beliefs (such as$\backslash$nfavourable attitudes towards monogamy, politically conservative beliefs$\backslash$nand fundamentalist religious beliefs) were more likely to have negative$\backslash$nattitudes towards polyamory, whereas participants exhibiting$\backslash$nthrill-seeking attitudes and behaviours were more likely to have$\backslash$npositive attitudes towards polyamory. Our results indicate that the ATP$\backslash$nScale is a brief, reliable and valid measure that can be used in future$\backslash$nresearch to assess people's attitudes towards the polyamorous$\backslash$nrelationship orientation.},

@article{Bitler2016b,
abstract = {Much attention has been given to the large increase in safety net spending, particularly in Unemployment Insurance and Food Stamp spending, during the Great Recession. In this paper we examine the relationship between poverty, the social safety net, and business cycles historically and test whether there has been a significant change in this relationship during the Great Recession. We do so using an alternative measure of poverty that incorporates taxes and in-kind transfers. We explore the mediating role played by four core safety net programs—Food Stamps, cash welfare (AFDC/TANF), the Earned Income Tax Credit, and Unemployment Insurance—in buffering families from negative economic shocks. This analysis yields several important findings. Our most robust and important finding is the safety net is doing less to provide protection for the most disadvantaged. In the post-welfare reform world, TANF did not respond in the Great Recession and extreme poverty is more cyclical than in prior recessions. On the other hand, Food Stamps and UI are providing more protection-or at least providing no less protection-in the Great Recession, although these results are less robust across our different models. These programs are more likely to affect households somewhat higher up the income distribution; we find some evidence of a reduction in cyclicality at 100{\%} poverty and little evidence about this at higher income-to-poverty levels.

policy concern in the United States. This paper studies take-up of
Section 8 housing vouchers, a program in which take-up rates are quite
low among interested and eligible households. We link 18,109 households
in Chicago that were offered vouchers through a lottery to
administrative data and study how baseline employment, earnings, public
assistance, arrests, residential location, and children's academic
performance predict take-up. Our analysis finds mixed evidence of
whether the most disadvantaged or distressed households face the largest
barriers to program participation. We also study the causal impact of
peer behavior on take-up by exploiting idiosyncratic variation in the
timing of voucher offers. We find that the probability of lease-up
increases with the number of neighbors who recently received voucher
offers. Finally, we explore the policy implications of increasing
housing voucher take-up by applying reweighting methods to existing
causal impact estimates of voucher receipt. This analysis suggests that
greater utilization of vouchers may lead to larger reductions in labor
market activity. Differences in take-up rates across settings may be
important to consider when assessing the external validity of studies
identifying the effects of public assistance programs.},

It would be useful, but not required, if participants were familiar with basic results from the literature on program evaluation and treatment effects (roughly at the level of (Wooldridge, 2010)). This course is meant to be self-contained and hence most underlying statistics/econometrics concepts and results are introduced and explained in class. There are several review articles on RD methodology and empirical practice. This course will discuss, and update as appropriate, topics in Imbens and Lemieux (2008) and Lee and Lemieux (2010). Since these reviews do not cover many of the most recent methodological results available in the literature, we are currently working on an up-to-date review on RD methodology (Cattaneo and Titiunik, 2016), which will be the main focus of this workshop.

abstract = {The labor market data from the establishment and household surveys for March broadly reflect the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The material below addresses some questions about the impact of the pandemic on The Employment Situation for March 2020, which presents national-level estimates from the establishment (Current Employment Statistics, or CES) and household (Current Population Survey, or CPS) surveys. Additional detail at the state and local area level will be available in forthcoming releases with data from the CES State and Metro Area and the Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) programs. We cannot precisely quantify the effects of the pandemic on the job market in March. However, it is clear that the decrease in employment and hours and the increase in unemployment can be ascribed to the effects of the illness and efforts to contain the virus. It is important to keep in mind that the March survey reference periods for both surveys predated many coronavirus-related business and school closures in the second half of the month. 1. Household and establishment surveys: What is the reference period for the two surveys? The household survey reference period is generally the calendar week that contains the 12th day of the month, in this case March 8th through March 14th. In the household survey, individuals are classified as employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force based on their answers to a series of questions about their activities during the survey reference week (March 8-14). In the establishment survey, workers who are paid by their employer for all or any part of the pay period including the 12th of the month are counted as employed, even if they were not actually at their jobs. Workers who are temporarily or permanently absent from their jobs and who are not being paid are not counted as employed, even if they continue to receive benefits. The length of the reference period does vary across respondents in the establishment survey; one-third of respondents have a weekly pay period, slightly over 40 percent a biweekly , about 20 percent semi-monthly, and a small amount monthly. 2. Establishment survey: Was there an impact on data collection in the establishment survey? Yes. In the establishment survey, about one-fifth of the data is generally collected by telephone at four regional data collection centers. Although these centers were closed during the collection period, efforts were made to collect data electronically. The establishment survey depends on the availability of survey respondents. Collection was adversely impacted due to the inability to reach some respondents. The collection rate for the establishment survey, at 66 percent, was about 9 percentage points lower than average. Although the collection rate was adversely affected by pandemic-related issues, BLS was still able to obtain estimates that met our standards for accuracy and reliability.},

abstract = {This paper measures the causal effect of time out of the labor force on subsequent employment of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) applicants and distinguishes it from the discouragement effect of receiving disability benefits. Using a unique Social Security Administration workload database to identify exogenous variation in decision times induced by differences in processing speed among disability examiners to whom applicants are randomly assigned, we find that longer processing times reduce the employment and earnings of SSDI applicants for multiple years following application, with the effects concentrated among applicants awarded benefits during their initial application. A one standard deviation (2.1 month) increase in initial processing time reduces long-run "substantial gainful activity" rates by 0.36 percentage points (3.5{\%}) and long-run annual earnings by {\$}178 (5.1{\%}). Because applicants initially denied benefits spend on average more than 15 additional months appealing their denials, previous estimates of the benefit receipt effect are confounded with the effect of delays on subsequent employment. Accounting separately for these channels, we find that the receipt effect is at least 50{\%} larger than previously estimated. Combining the delay and benefits receipt channels reveals that the SSDI application process reduces subsequent employment of applicants on the margin of award by twice as much as prior literature suggests.},

abstract = {Concrete-faced rockfill dams (CFRD) are widely used in large-scale hydraulic projects. The face slab, the key seepage-proof structure of great concern, has a strong interaction with the neighboring gravel cushion layer due to a significant difference in their stiffness. An elasto-plasticity damage interface element, a numerical format of the EPDI model, is described for numerical analysis of a CFRD that can trace the separation and re-contact between the face slab and the cushion layer at the interface. As verified by simulating slide block and direct shear interface tests, this element was confirmed to capture effectively the primary monotonic and cyclic behaviors of the interface. This element can easily be extended to the finite element method (FEM) programs that involve the Goodman interface element. The analysis of a typical CFRD showed that the interface model describes a significant effect on the stress response of the face slab under different conditions, including dam construction, water storage, and earthquake. Treatments of the cushion layer, such as an asphalt layer, changed the behavior of the interface between it and the face slab, which resulted in a significant effect on the stress response of the face slab. The top of the face slab exhibited a significant separation from the cushion layer during construction, induced mainly by construction of the neighboring dam body. {\&}copy; 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We randomly altered the r{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}}s to indicate affiliation in one of seven religious groups or a control group. We found that applicants who expressed a religious identity were 26 percent less likely to receive a response from employers. In general, Muslims, pagans, and atheists suffered the highest levels of discriminatory treatment from employers, a fictitious religious group and Catholics experienced moderate levels, evangelical Christians encountered little, and Jews received no discernible discrimination. We also found evidence suggesting the possibility that Jews received preferential treatment over other religious groups in employer responses. The results fit best with models of religious discrimination rooted in secularization theory and cultural distaste theory. We briefly discuss what our findings suggest for a more robust theory of prejudice and discrimination in society.},

abstract = {We consider inference in regression discontinuity designs when the running variable only takes a moderate number of distinct values. In particular, we study the common practice of using confidence intervals (CIs) based on standard errors that are clustered by the running variable as a means to make inference robust to model misspecification (Lee and Card, 2008). We derive theoretical results and present simulation and empirical evidence showing that these CIs do not guard against model misspecification, and that they have poor coverage properties. We therefore recommend against using these CIs in practice. We instead propose two alternative CIs with guaranteed coverage properties under easily interpretable restrictions on the conditional expectation function.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the United States, people of color face disparities in access to health care, the quality of care received, and health outcomes. The attitudes and behaviors of health care providers have been identified as one of many factors that contribute to health disparities. Implicit attitudes are thoughts and feelings that often exist outside of conscious awareness, and thus are difficult to consciously acknowledge and control. These attitudes are often automatically activated and can influence human behavior without conscious volition. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the extent to which implicit racial/ethnic bias exists among health care professionals and examined the relationships between health care professionals' implicit attitudes about racial/ethnic groups and health care outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: To identify relevant studies, we searched 10 computerized bibliographic databases and used a reference harvesting technique. SELECTION CRITERIA: We assessed eligibility using double independent screening based on a priori inclusion criteria. We included studies if they sampled existing health care providers or those in training to become health care providers, measured and reported results on implicit racial/ethnic bias, and were written in English. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We included a total of 15 studies for review and then subjected them to double independent data extraction. Information extracted included the citation, purpose of the study, use of theory, study design, study site and location, sampling strategy, response rate, sample size and characteristics, measurement of relevant variables, analyses performed, and results and findings. We summarized study design characteristics, and categorized and then synthesized substantive findings. MAIN RESULTS: Almost all studies used cross-sectional designs, convenience sampling, US participants, and the Implicit Association Test to assess implicit bias. Low to moderate levels of implicit racial/ethnic bias were found among health care professionals in all but 1 study. These implicit bias scores are similar to those in the general population. Levels of implicit bias against Black, Hispanic/Latino/Latina, and dark-skinned people were relatively similar across these groups. Although some associations between implicit bias and health care outcomes were nonsignificant, results also showed that implicit bias was significantly related to patient-provider interactions, treatment decisions, treatment adherence, and patient health outcomes. Implicit attitudes were more often significantly related to patient-provider interactions and health outcomes than treatment processes. CONCLUSIONS: Most health care providers appear to have implicit bias in terms of positive attitudes toward Whites and negative attitudes toward people of color. Future studies need to employ more rigorous methods to examine the relationships between implicit bias and health care outcomes. Interventions targeting implicit attitudes among health care professionals are needed because implicit bias may contribute to health disparities for people of color. (Am J Public Health.

Aims: This research examined how the variables of race and gender of both the nurse and the patient influence nurses' decision making about pain management. Design: A randomized four-group post-test–only experimental design was used to examine the variables and variable interactions. Settings: An investigator-developed case vignette tool hosted online was used to obtain data about nursing pain management decisions. The vignette intervention was developed to simulate four exact patient scenarios that differed only by patient race and gender. Participants/Subjects: A quota sample of 400 nurses was recruited using a self-selected face-to-face recruitment technique. Methods: A four-way between-groups analysis of variance assessed whether the gender of the nurse, race of the nurse, gender of the patient, or race of the patient made any differences in the dose intensity of pain medications selected by the nurse sample. Results: No significant interactions were noted between any combinations of the four independent variables. A significant main effect was noted in medication intensity for nurse gender (F [1,384] = 9.75, p =.002). Conclusions: Data trends suggested that gender stereotypes about how patients managed pain played a role in dose intensity decisions because female patients on average were given higher doses of pain medication than male patients were by all the nurses in the study. Further research is needed in this complex area of study.},

In this paper, we examine whether the rollout also affected the social connections that teens make. Specifically, we look at the relationship between increased broadband access and teen fertility. We hypothesize that increasing access to high-speed internet can influence fertility decisions by changing the size of the market as well as increasing the information available to participants in the market. We seek to understand both the overall effect of broadband internet on teen fertility and the mechanisms underlying this effect. Our results suggest that increased broadband access explains at least 7 {\%} of the decline in the teen birth rate between 1999 and 2007. Although we focus on social markets, this work contributes more broadly to an understanding of how new technol-ogy interacts with existing markets.},

abstract = {Recent research has identified various structural and ideological barriers to mental health treatment seeking among Black Americans. However, the ever-increasing role of online sources by which potential clients encounter mental health practitioners remains underex- amined. The present study aims to investigate the impact of characteristics in a therapist's online profile on interest in pursuing treatment among a sample of Black and White Americans. Participants were asked to rate their interest in seeking treatment from a therapist after being presented with vignettes simulating online profiles that either contained an expression of religious inclusivity and a commitment to serving minority groups or did not contain these statements. Black participants reported equal levels of interest in seeking treatment from therapists whether these expressions were included or not. Conversely, White participants expressed lower levels of treatment interest from therapists when these multiculturally sensitive statements were included. Furthermore, more Black participants viewed the race of the therapist as important to their decision-making than White partici- pants. Results of the study suggest that the contents of brief therapist biographies can influence treatment-seeking attitudes. Furthermore, Black and White participants may respond differently to the contents of online profiles when treatment seeking. Practitioner recommendations for the marketing of mental health services are explored.},

The purpose of this manuscript is to briefly review the literature characterizing barriers to health care for transgender individuals and to propose research priorities to understand mechanisms of those barriers and interventions to overcome them. Recent Findings-Current research emphasizes sexual minorities' self report of barriers, rather than using direct methods. The biggest barrier to health care reported by transgender individuals is lack of access due to lack of providers who are sufficiently knowledgeable on the topic. Other barriers include: financial barriers, discrimination, lack of cultural competence by providers, health systems barriers and socioeconomic barriers. Summary-National research priorities should include rigorous determination of the capacity of the United States health care system to provide adequate care for transgender individuals. Studies should determine knowledge and biases of the medical work force across the spectrum of medical training with regard to transgender medical care; adequacy of sufficient providers for the care},

To do so, we designed a correspondence experiment to be conducted in schools. We created three types of fictitious couples-one heterosexual, one gay, and one lesbian-and sent emails to schools in which the couples' sexual orientation was explicit. Our results show that gay couples had a significantly lower (22 percentage points) call-back probability than heterosexual couples. No statistically significant differences in call-back probability were found between the lesbian and heterosexual couples.},

abstract = {Regression discontinuity designs have become popular in empirical studies due to their attractive properties for estimating causal effects under transparent assumptions. Nonetheless, most popular procedures assume i.i.d. data, which is unreasonable in many common applications. To fill this gap, we derive the properties of traditional local polynomial estimators in a fixed-G setting that allows for cluster dependence in the error term. Simulation results demonstrate that accounting for clustering in the data while selecting bandwidths may lead to lower MSE while maintaining proper coverage. We then apply our cluster-robust procedure to an application examining the impact of Low-Income Housing Tax Credits on neighborhood characteristics and low-income housing supply.},

The remaining pay gap — experienced by employees whose impairments should not limit their productivity — reflects potential discrimination. The discrimination-related pay gaps appear to be smallest and possibly non-existent for women and men with hearing impairments, and largest for those with cognitive and mobility impairments. Overall the results indicate that discrimination is likely to remain an influence on the pay of many workers with disabilities.},

abstract = {Many researchers and journals place a strong emphasis on the sign and statistical significance of effects-but often there is very little emphasis on the substantive and practical significance of the findings. As Long and Freese (2006, Regression Models for Categorical Dependent Variables Using Stata [Stata Press]) show, results can often be made more tangible by computing predicted or expected values for hypothetical or prototypical cases. Stata 11 introduced new tools for making such calculations-factor variables and the margins command. These can do most of the things that were previously done by Stata's own adjust and mfx commands, and much more. Unfortunately, the complexity of the margins syntax, the daunting 50-page reference manual entry that describes it, and a lack of understanding about what margins offers over older commands that have been widely used for years may have dissuaded some researchers from examining how the margins command could benefit them. In this article, therefore, I explain what adjusted predictions and marginal effects are, and how they can contribute to the interpretation of results. I further explain why older commands, like adjust and mfx, can often produce incorrect results, and how factor variables and the margins command can avoid these errors. The relative merits of different methods for setting representative values for variables in the model (marginal effects at the means, average marginal effects, and marginal effects at representative values) are considered. I shows how the marginsplot command (introduced in Stata 12) provides a graphical and often much easier means for presenting and understanding the results from margins, and explain why margins does not present marginal effects for interaction terms. {\textcopyright} 2012 StataCorp LP.},

In seven studies, we find that older men face the strongest prescriptions to behave less agentically and cede resources, whereas older women are comparatively spared. We show that agency prescriptions more strongly target older men, compared to older women (Studies 1a, 1b, 2) and their younger counterparts (Studies 3 and 4) and examine social and economic consequences for agentic behavior in political, economic, and academic domains. We also find that older men garner more extreme (i.e., polarized) reactions due to their greater perceived resource threat (Studies 4-6).

@article{Green2007,
abstract = {CONTEXT: Studies documenting racial/ethnic disparities in health care frequently implicate physicians' unconscious biases. No study to date has measured physicians' unconscious racial bias to test whether this predicts physicians' clinical decisions. OBJECTIVE: To test whether physicians show implicit race bias and whether the magnitude of such bias predicts thrombolysis recommendations for black and white patients with acute coronary syndromes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An internet-based tool comprising a clinical vignette of a patient presenting to the emergency department with an acute coronary syndrome, followed by a questionnaire and three Implicit Association Tests (IATs). Study invitations were e-mailed to all internal medicine and emergency medicine residents at four academic medical centers in Atlanta and Boston; 287 completed the study, met inclusion criteria, and were randomized to either a black or white vignette patient. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: IAT scores (normal continuous variable) measuring physicians' implicit race preference and perceptions of cooperativeness. Physicians' attribution of symptoms to coronary artery disease for vignette patients with randomly assigned race, and their decisions about thrombolysis. Assessment of physicians' explicit racial biases by questionnaire. RESULTS: Physicians reported no explicit preference for white versus black patients or differences in perceived cooperativeness. In contrast, IATs revealed implicit preference favoring white Americans (mean IAT score = 0.36, P {\textless} .001, one-sample t test) and implicit stereotypes of black Americans as less cooperative with medical procedures (mean IAT score 0.22, P {\textless} .001), and less cooperative generally (mean IAT score 0.30, P {\textless} .001). As physicians' prowhite implicit bias increased, so did their likelihood of treating white patients and not treating black patients with thrombolysis (P = .009). CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first evidence of unconscious (implicit) race bias among physicians, its dissociation from conscious (explicit) bias, and its predictive validity. Results suggest that physicians' unconscious biases may contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in use of medical procedures such as thrombolysis for myocardial infarction.},

While average effects provide very convenient scalar summaries of typical effects, by definition they fail to reflect the entire variety of the heterogeneous effects. In order to discover these effects much more fully, we propose to estimate and report sorted effects -- a collection of estimated partial effects sorted in increasing order and indexed by percentiles. By construction the sorted effect curves completely represent and help visualize the range of the heterogeneous effects in one plot. They are as convenient and easy to report in practice as the conventional average partial effects. They also serve as a basis for classification analysis, where we divide the observational units into most or least affected groups and summarize their characteristics. We provide a quantification of uncertainty (standard errors and confidence bands) for the estimated sorted effects and related classification analysis, and provide confidence sets for the most and least affected groups. The derived statistical results rely on establishing key, new mathematical results on Hadamard differentiability of a multivariate sorting operator and a related classification operator, which are of independent interest. We apply the sorted effects method and classification analysis to demonstrate several striking patterns in the gender wage gap.},

METHODS: We analyzed data from the 2003-2010 Washington State Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (n = 96 992) on health outcomes, chronic conditions, access to care, behaviors, and screening by gender and sexual orientation with adjusted logistic regressions. RESULTS: LGB older adults had higher risk of disability, poor mental health, smoking, and excessive drinking than did heterosexuals. Lesbians and bisexual women had higher risk of cardiovascular disease and obesity, and gay and bisexual men had higher risk of poor physical health and living alone than did heterosexuals. Lesbians reported a higher rate of excessive drinking than did bisexual women; bisexual men reported a higher rate of diabetes and a lower rate of being tested for HIV than did gay men. Conclusions. Tailored interventions are needed to address the health disparities and unique health needs of LGB older adults. Research across the life course is needed to better understand health disparities by sexual orientation and age, and to assess subgroup differences within these communities.},

The results hold with tribe fixed effects, identifying only off within-tribe variation across reservations.

It underscores the power dimension around non/monogamy and reveals the complexity of contradictory dynamics of discrimination and privileging around non/monogamous life choices.

We estimate employer search activity and bias in interview callbacks. We find evidence of employers searching online for the candidates. At the national level, we find no significant difference in the callback rates for a Muslim versus a Christian candidate, or for a gay versus a straight candidate. However, employers in Republican areas exhibit significant bias against the Muslim candidate relative to the Christian candidate. This bias is significantly larger than the bias in Democratic areas. The results on callback bias are robust to using state- and county-level data, to controlling for firm, job, and geographical characteristics, to including additional interaction effects in the empirical specification, and to several estimation strategies. The results suggest that the online disclosure of certain personal traits can influence the hiring decisions of some U.S. employers, but the likelihood of hiring discrimination via online searches varies across employers.},

We assemble novel data linking individuals from housing court cases in New York City to administrative data and leverage the random assignment of cases to courtrooms to estimate the causal effect of evictions on homelessness, health, earn- ings, employment, and public assistance receipt. Evictions cause large and persistent increases in risk of homelessness, elevate long-term residential instability, and increase emergency room use. We find some evidence that evictions lower earnings modestly, but little evidence that they substantially worsen employment outcomes or increase re- ceipt of public assistance. These results suggest that eviction prevention policies could provide important consumption smoothing benefits to low-income households but are unlikely to substantially reduce poverty on their own. ∗Corresponding},

We hypothesized that whereas physicians' explicit bias would predict their own reactions, physicians' implicit bias, in combination with physician explicit (self-reported) bias, would predict patients' reactions. Specifically, we predicted that patients would react most negatively when their physician fit the profile of an aversive racist (i.e., low explicit-high implicit bias). The hypothesis about the effects of explicit bias on physicians' reactions was partially supported. The aversive racism hypothesis received support. Black patients had less positive reactions to medical interactions with physicians relatively low in explicit but relatively high in implicit bias than to interactions with physicians who were either: (a) low in both explicit and implicit bias, or (b) high in both explicit and implicit bias. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

abstract = {Replication of empirical findings plays a fundamental role in science. Among experimental psychologists, successful replication enhances belief in a finding, while a failure to replicate is often interpreted to mean that one of the experiments is flawed. This view is wrong. Because experimental psychology uses statistics, empirical findings should appear with predictable probabilities. In a misguided effort to demonstrate successful replication of empirical findings and avoid failures to replicate, experimental psychologists sometimes report too many positive results. Rather than strengthen confidence in an effect, too much successful replication actually indicates publication bias, which invalidates entire sets of experimental findings. Researchers cannot judge the validity of a set of biased experiments because the experiment set may consist entirely of type I errors. This article shows how an investigation of the effect sizes from reported experiments can test for publication bias by looking for too much successful replication. Simulated experiments demonstrate that the publication bias test is able to discriminate biased experiment sets from unbiased experiment sets, but it is conservative about reporting bias. The test is then applied to several studies of prominent phenomena that highlight how publication bias contaminates some findings in experimental psychology. Additional simulated experiments demonstrate that using Bayesian methods of data analysis can reduce (and in some cases, eliminate) the occurrence of publication bias. Such methods should be part of a systematic process to remove publication bias from experimental psychology and reinstate the important role of replication as a final arbiter of scientific findings. {\textcopyright} 2012 Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

We take advantage of the randomized roll-out of Ecuador's cash transfer program to mothers to investigate how an exogenous increase in a woman's income affects domestic violence. We find that the effect of a cash transfer depends on a woman's education and on her education relative to her partner's. Our results show that for women with greater than primary school education a cash transfer significantly decreases psychological violence from her partner. For women with primary school education or less, however, the effect of a cash transfer depends on her education relative to her partner's. Specifically, the cash transfer significantly increases emotional violence in households where the woman's education is equal to or more than her partner's. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Most financial variables (e.g., interest rates and asset prices), on the other hand, are sampled daily or even more frequently. The challenge is how to best use available data. To that end, the authors survey some common methods for dealing with mixed-frequency data. They show that, in some cases, simply averaging the higher-frequency data produces no discernible disadvantage. In other cases, however, explicitly modeling the flow of data (e.g., using mixed data sampling as in Ghysels, Santa-Clara, and Valkanov, 2004) may be more beneficial to the forecaster, especially if the forecaster is inter- ested in constructing intra-period forecasts.

abstract = {Introduction: Gender-related stereotypes of pain may account for some assessment and treatment disparities among patients. Among health care providers, demographic factors including gender and profession may influence the use of gender cues in pain management decision-making. The Gender Role Expectations of Pain Questionnaire was developed to assess gender-related stereotypic attributions of pain regarding sensitivity, endurance, and willingness to report pain, and has not yet been used in a sample of health care providers. The purpose of this study was to examine the presence of gender role expectation of pain among health care providers. It was hypothesized that health care providers of both genders would endorse gender stereotypic views of pain and physicians would be more likely than dentists to endorse these views. Methods: One-hundred and sixty-nine providers (89 dentists, 80 physicians; 40{\%} women) were recruited as part of a larger study examining providers' use of demographic cues in making pain management decisions. Participants completed the Gender Role Expectations of Pain Questionnaire to assess the participant's views of gender differences in pain sensitivity, pain endurance, and willingness to report pain. Results: Results of repeated measures analysis of variance revealed that health care providers of both genders endorsed stereotypic views of pain regarding willingness to report pain (F(1,165)=34.241, P{\textless}0.001; d=0.479). Furthermore, female dentists rated men as having less endurance than women (F(1,165)=4.654, P=0.032; d=0.333). Conclusion: These findings affirm the presence of some gender-related stereotypic views among health care providers and suggest the presence of a view among health care providers that men are underreporting their pain in comparison to women. Future work can refine the effects of social learning history and other psychosocial factors that contribute to gender and provider differences in pain management decisions. {\textcopyright} 2018 Wesolowicz et al.},

We show that when identification is weak (i.e., when the discontinuity is of a small magnitude), the usual t-test based on the FRD estimator and its standard error suffers from asymptotic size distortions as in a standard instrumental variables setting. This problem can be especially severe in the FRD setting since only observations close to the discontinuity are useful for estimating the treatment effect. To eliminate those size distortions, we propose a modified t-statistic that uses a null-restricted version of the standard error of the FRD estimator. Simple and asymptotically valid confidence sets for the treatment effect can be also constructed using this null-restricted standard error. An extension to testing for constancy of the regression discontinuity effect across covariates is also discussed. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

abstract = {In a seminal paper Abadie et al (2010) develop the synthetic control procedure for estimating the effect of a treatment, in the presence of a single treated unit and a number of control units, with pre-treatment outcomes observed for all units. The method constructs a set of weights such that covariates and pre-treatment outcomes of the treated unit are approximately matched by a weighted average of control units. The weights are restricted to be nonnegative and sum to one, which allows the procedure to obtain the weights even when the number of lagged outcomes is modest relative to the number of control units, a setting that is not uncommon in applications. In the current paper we propose a more general class of synthetic control estimators that allows researchers to relax some of the restrictions in the ADH method. We allow the weights to be negative, do not necessarily restrict the sum of the weights, and allow for a permanent additive difference between the treated unit and the controls, similar to difference-indifference procedures. The weights directly minimize the distance between the lagged outcomes for the treated and the control units, using regularization methods to deal with a potentially large number of possible control units.},

We base our evaluation on two kinds of evidence: an examination of aggregate data over long time periods and across countries, and a critical review of the literature. We argue that economists know little about the empirically relevant determinants of crime. Even hypotheses that find some support in U.S. data for recent decades are inconsistent with data over longer horizons or across countries. This conclusion applies both to policy variables like arrest rates or capital punishment and to less conventional factors such as abortion or gun laws. The hypothesis that drug prohibition generates violence, however, is generally consistent with the long times-series and cross-country facts. This analysis is also consistent with a broader perspective in which government policies that affect the nature and amount of dispute resolution play an important role in determining violence.},

abstract = {One particularly persistent and prevalent negative age stereotype is that older workers are less innovative and more resistant to change. Because older workers are also more likely to have longer organizational tenure, negative age stereotypes contribute to the perception that long-tenured workers are less innovative and more resistant to change, too. Guided by human capital theory, this study argues that the capacity to contribute to innovation-related behaviours (IRB) might actually grow with age and tenure, counteracting the presumed age-related declines in this type of job performance. Using a meta-analysis that included 98 empirical studies, the present research examines the relationships of age and organizational tenure with the generation, dissemination, and implementation of new ideas. Overall, the pattern of results in the study suggests that older workers and longer-tenured workers do not engage in less innovation-related behaviour than their younger and more junior counterparts. In addition, there is little evidence of curvilinearity in the relationships of age and tenure with IRB; workers at the high end of the age and tenure distributions did not perform especially poorly on these tasks. Practitioner points: 1. Contrary to common belief, the results of this study show that age and tenure are not negatively related to innovation-related behaviours. 2. That is, older and longer-tenured workers do not engage in less innovation-related behaviour than younger, more junior workers. 3. These results hold true even at the high end of the age and years-of-service continuum. 3. This study concludes that the negative stereotype that older and longer-tenured workers are less innovative is not based on accumulated empirical evidence. 4. As such, excluding older workers from innovation-related tasks is counterproductive. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

However, any fee increase would serve to intensify concerns among citizens that only relatively affluent Kenyans can afford to visit MMNPR. Park managers need to demonstrate that the extra revenue would be used to fund the proposed conservation activities. This valuation study demonstrates that visitors are prepared to pay higher user fees for access to the marine protected area revealing considerable untapped resource to finance reef quality improvements.},

abstract = {In this study, the authors investigated whether psychotherapist bias related to client bisexuality is most likely to occur with respect to judgments about stereotype-relevant clinical issues. Participants were 108 psychotherapists who read a fictitious intake report about a male client who was portrayed as heterosexual, gay, or bisexual. Client sexual orientation was behaviorally operationalized through reference to the sex of the client's present and previous romantic partners. Participants rated the case for the salience of a variety of clinical issues (some of which were related to bisexual stereotypes), global psychological functioning, and anticipated reactions to the client. Client sexual orientation had no effect for outcomes unrelated to bisexual stereotypes. In contrast, clinical issues related to bisexual stereotypes were rated as most salient to the case when the client was portrayed as bisexual rather than when the client was portrayed as heterosexual or gay. This effect remained significant even when participants' self-reported ability to avoid bias, self-presentational concerns, and response set related to perceptions of psychopathology were controlled for. Exploratory analyses suggested that this effect was partially mediated by stereotypes of bisexual men as confused and conflicted. (Contains 2 figures and 4 tables.)},

abstract = {This article analyses motion picture box-office gross revenue using a cross- section of films from 1997 to 2001. The dependent variable is total domestic box-office revenue. The independent variables investigated include: production budget; peak number of screens that the film was shown on in theaters; Consumer price index for movie tickets; personal income; season and year of the release in theaters; a measure of pre-existing audience; aggregate critic rating; MPAA rating; genre; word-of-mouth recommendation; the presence of popular stars and the award nomina- tions. A distinction is made in the analysis between information available to the public prior to the release of the film in theaters (ex ante) and information available to the public after the film opens in theaters (ex post). Results for the ex ante ordinary least squares (OLS) regression reveal positive impacts of budget, summer and holiday release dates, critical reviews, sequels and several genres on gross revenue. Significant, positive determinants in the ex post OLS regressions include budget, the peak number of screens, sequels, critical reviews, summer and holiday releases, word-of-mouth, award nominations and star power. I. Introduction A differing assortment of films is released to the American viewing public every Friday. While some movies generate immediate box-office success and remain in the theaters for many weeks, others are quickly removed from the screens and promptly replaced with new box-office hopefuls. Cinema statistics provide little comfort to film producers: ‘of any 10 major theatrical films produced, on average 6 or 7 are unprofitable, and 1 will break even' (Vogel, 1990, p. 29). With such dim prospects, motion picture production studios are constantly seeking to discover the formula for financially successful films. Fortunately for film producers, an eager group of scholars is devoted to studying the motion pict},

abstract = {Negative attitudes and discrimination against Latinos exist in the dominant U.S. culture and in healthcare systems, contributing to ongoing health disparities. This article provides findings of a pilot test of Yo Veo Salud (I See Health), an intervention designed to positively modify attitudes toward Latinos among medical trainees. The research question was: Compared to the comparison group, did the intervention group show lower levels of implicit bias against Latinos versus Whites, and higher levels of ethnocultural empathy, healthcare empathy, and patient-centeredness? We used a sequential cohort, post-test design to evaluate Yo Veo Salud with a sample of 69 medical trainees. The intervention setting was an academic medical institution in a Southeastern U.S. state with a fast-growing Latino population. The intervention was delivered, and data were collected online, between July and December of 2014. Participants in the intervention group showed greater ethnocultural empathy, healthcare empathy, and patient-centeredness, compared to the comparison group. The implicit measure assessed four attitudinal dimensions (pleasantness, responsibility, compliance, and safety). Comparisons between our intervention and comparison groups did not find any average differences in implicit anti-Latino bias between the groups. However, in a subset analysis of White participants, White participants in the intervention group demonstrated a significantly decreased level of implicit bias in terms of pleasantness. A dose response was also founded indicating that participants involved in more parts of the intervention showed more change on all measures. Our findings, while modest in size, provide proof of concept for Yo Veo Salud as a means for increasing ethno-cultural and physician empathy, and patient-centeredness among medical residents and decreasing implicit provider bias toward Latinos.},

abstract = {We quantify how sensitive is migration by star scientists to changes in personal and business tax differentials across states. We uncover large, stable, and precisely estimated effects of personal and corporate taxes on star scientists' migration patterns. The long-run elasticity of mobility relative to taxes is 1.8 for personal income taxes, 1.9 for state corporate income tax, and −1.7 for the investment tax credit. While there are many other factors that drive when innovative individuals and innovative companies decide to locate, there are enough firms and workers on the margin that state taxes matter. In the United States, personal taxes vary enormously from state to state. These geographical differences are particularly large for high income taxpayers. Figure 1 shows the average tax rate (ATR) component due solely to state individual income taxes for a taxpayer with income at the ninety-ninth percentile nationally in 2010. 1 The ATRs in California, Oregon, and Maine were 8.1 percent, 9.1 percent, and 7.7 percent, respectively. By contrast, Washington, Texas, Florida, and six other states had zero income tax. 2 Large differences are also observed in business taxes. As shown in Figure 2, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota had corporate income tax (CIT) rates of 12 percent, 9.99 percent, and 9.8 percent, respectively, while Washington, Nevada, and three other states had no corporate tax at all. And not only do tax rates vary substantially across states, they also vary within states over time. Figure 3, for instance, shows how states' individual income ATRs changed during 1 We map here the average tax rate component due solely to state income taxes, rather than the full average tax rate which accounts additionally for federal income taxes, in order to illustrate the ATR differences driven by state tax policy differences. Our empirical analyses in the remainder of the paper utilize the full ATR. 2 One of those six, Alaska, is not shown on the map.},

abstract = {A study was conducted to survey the residents of Bombay and elicit their willingness to pay for the maintainance and preservation of Borivli National Park (BNP) using the Contingent Valuation (CV) method. The CV method has come under considerable criticism on account of biases that are either inherent to, or generated by the survey process. The present study acknowledges those, and adopts techniques to either circumvent or then minimise them. The authors pay special attention to hypothetical bias, starting point bias, embedding effects and part-whole biases. The authors argue that indeed it is possible to improve the quality of a CV by using special survey as well as statistical techniques so that CV results can be used for the purposes of realistic decision making. This validation of the CV becomes an important objective of the study. Despite India being a developing country with medium to low income levels, the evidence suggested that people are willing to pay for preserving environmental amenities. Having statistically adjusted for embedding and anchoring effects, households are willing to pay exclusively for BNP, on average, Rs 7.5, per month, for the next five years. Extrapolating to the city of Bombay, this amounts to a substantial Rs 20 million each month for the next five years, or a present discounted value of in excess of Rs 1 billion, suggesting a strong interest in environmental conservation.},

This paper re-examines the evidence using a simple instrumental variables scheme to deal with the fact that tenure is likely to be related to unobserved individual and job characteristics that affect the wage. We use the variation of tenure over a given job match as the principal instrumental variable for tenure. The variation in tenure over the job is uncorrelated by construction with the fixed individual and job match specific components of the error term of the wage equation. Our main finding is that the partial effect of tenure on wages is small, and that general labour market experience and job shopping account for most wage growth over a career. The strong cross section relationship between tenure and wages is due primarily to heterogeneity bias.},

Feeling thermometer ratings of transgender people were strongly correlated with attitudes toward gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals, but were significantly less favorable. Attitudes toward transgender people were more negative among heterosexual men than women. Negative attitudes were associated with endorsement of a binary conception of gender; higher levels of psychological authoritarianism, political conservatism, and anti-egalitarianism, and (for women) religiosity; and lack of personal contact with sexual minorities. In regression analysis, sexual prejudice accounted for much of the variance in transgender attitudes, but respondent gender, educational level, authoritarianism, anti-egalitarianism, and (for women) religiosity remained significant predictors with sexual prejudice statistically controlled. Implications and directions for future research on attitudes toward transgender people are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {This article assesses whether housing in predominantly minority and integrated neighborhoods appreciates more slowly than comparable housing in predominantly white communities, and if so, the extent to which inequality is due to neighborhood racial composition per se rather than nonracial socioeconomic and housing structure factors. I take a dynamic approach to the issue of housing appreciation, considering both racial, ethnic, and poverty composition at purchase and change in those characteristics over time. I examine differences in real housing appreciation across black, white, and Hispanic households by applying a hedonic price analysis to data from the Health and Retirement Study, combined with data from the 1970, 1980, and 1990 Census. While much of neighborhood appreciation inequality is explained by nonracial (particularly socioeconomic) factors, minority composition continues to exert a significant effect on appreciation even net of these considerations, particularly in highly segregated communities and those that experience large increases in black representation. Unequal housing appreciation has a large negative impact on the overall wealth holdings of mature minority households, and has important implications for racial and ethnic stratification.},

Under some fairly weak conditions, the selection procedures in one class are asymp- totically valid if there exist fixed-dimension correct models; the selection procedures in another class are asymptotically valid if no fixed-dimension correct model exists. The procedures in the third class are compromises of the procedures in the first two classes. Some empirical results are also presented.},

A nationwide telephone survey was conducted among senior-level human resources (HR) executives at 400 companies selected from Dun and Bradstreet's national business list. Roughly 100 respondents were interviewed in each of 4 company-size categories: 50-99 employees, 100-499 employees, 500-999 employees, and 1,000 or more employees. Among the 29 employee qualities included in the survey, older employees were believed to possess all but 1 of the top 7 qualities that companies consider most desirable; "willing to be flexible about doing different tasks" was the category in which they were perceived to fall short. Older employees were rated lower than younger employees for skill-related qualities, such as trying new approaches, learning new technologies, and having up-to-date job skills. However, they were recognized for having a good work ethic and for providing experience, knowledge, and stability in the workplace. HR managers considered finding and keeping skilled employees to be the most important issues facing employers. The survey findings suggest that American businesses do not yet regard the aging of the workforce as a compelling business issue.},

Winning and losing counties have similar trends in TFP prior to the new plant opening. Five years after the opening, incumbent plants' TFP is 12 percent higher in winning counties. This productivity spillover is larger for plants sharing similar labor and technology pools with the new plant. Consistent with spatial equilibrium models, labor costs increase in winning counties, indicating that profits ultimately increase less than productivity.

Design/methodology/approach – Recently published reports and articles related to the film industry and film tourism in particular are thoroughly reviewed. Findings – Although most tourism organizations and film commissions have been slow to tap the potential benefits of film tourism, the examples highlighted show how partnerships between the two industries can be mutually beneficial. Practical implications – If leveraged well, film tourism can have large economic gains for countries and regions. Destination marketing organizations should be working with film commissions and engaging in marketing activities at four distinct stages of a film's lifecycle; before production of a film, during production, during release of the film, and after release. Originality/value – This is the first full film tourism paper to reflect on existing collaboration between the film and tourism industries.},

Within-group analysis of lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons included 1166 individuals (weighted proportion = 3.15{\%}); within-group heterosexual analysis included 35 608 individuals (weighted proportion = 96.58{\%}); and pooled analysis of lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons and heterosexuals included 36 774 individuals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Same-sex married lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons were significantly less distressed than lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons not in a legally recognized relationship; married heterosexuals were significantly less distressed than nonmarried heterosexuals.

abstract = {Contemporary American Indians and Alaska Natives (AIs/ANs) who live in urban areas today face the daunting task of navigating an urban landscape while maintaining the facets of their respective Native cultures. While AIs/ANs continue to grapple with the intergenerational trauma associated with forced assimilation, relocation movements, and boarding schools, these traumas have manifested themselves in elevated rates of psychopathology. AIs/ANs have elevated rates of domestic abuse, poverty, suicide, and substance misuse. Furthermore, AIs/ANs, like many other minority cultures often face discrimination in their everyday lives. In light of the aversive experiences they face, AI/AN people have followed the tenets of ritual and traditional healing to address imbalances in the body, mind, and spirit. For providers working with AI/AN clients, it is important to understand who is using traditional healing and why they are using alternative services. Secondary data analyses of survey data from 389 urban AIs/ANs were utilized in order to determine the relationship between experiences of discrimination and traditional healing use. Analyses indicated that experiences of discrimination in healthcare settings were significantly associated with participation in traditional healing. Analyses also indicated that nearly a quarter of the sample reported discrimination in a healthcare setting, roughly half of the sample had used traditional healing, and that the majority of those who had used traditional healing were women, and ages 35-44 (27 {\%}). This study calls attention to the socio-demographic factors implicated in traditional healing use by urban AI/AN people, in addition to the clinical and demographic characteristics of this sample. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {This paper documents American job quality since the late 1970s, surveys leading explanations, and considers the evidence. We focus primarily on wage outcomes for the bottom half of the distribution, beginning with key dimensions of unshared growth in recent decades: the stagnation and decline of real wages and working-age incomes in the bottom-half of the distribution; the rising incidence of low pay, which has been especially pronounced for young workers with less than a college degree; the strong correspondence between wage levels and non-wage benefits and working conditions across four wage contours that range from poverty-wage to good-wage jobs; and recent evidence on changes in the incidence of nonstandard work. We group the main explanations for these developments into three broad visions of how the labor market works: the competitive market model, in which supply and demand for worker skills in competitive external labor markets generates a single market wage by skill group that reflects the worker's marginal product; contested market models, in which wage-setting takes place in imperfectly competitive labor markets in which firms typically have substantial bargaining (monopsony) power; and social-institutional models, which share the contested market models' emphasis on within-firm bargaining over rents but place greater emphasis on the public policies, formal and informal institutions, and the dynamics of workplace cultures and conflict within administered internal labor markets. A review of the explanatory evidence follows, beginning with a critical evaluation of the supply-demand explanation, which has focused on evidence of occupational employment polarization (driven by skill-biased production technologies) and the rise in the college-wage premium. We review the burgeoning research literature that has explored non-skill-based outcomes at the level of establishments, firms and industries. This bargaining power literature is organized into four groups: the increasing market concentration and power of firms, the eroding power of countervailing labor institutions and policies, the acceleration of within-firm employment restructuring (fissuring), and cross-country comparisons. We conclude by summarizing policy recommendations that follow from each of these visions of the post-1979 American labor market.},

abstract = {This study evaluates the cumulated empirical evidence on 6 common age stereotypes. These stereotypes suggest that older workers are: (a) less motivated, (b) generally less willing to participate in training and career development, (c) more resistant and less willing to change, (d) less trusting, (e) less healthy, and (f) more vulnerable to work-family imbalance. The meta-analysis included 418 empirical studies (N= 208,204) and examined the relationships of age to 39 variables representing the content domain of age stereotypes. The only stereotype consistent with empirical evidence is that older workers are less willing to participate in training and career development activities. The paper concludes with implications for future theory development and management practice.},

abstract = {This study is intended to clarify the nature of beliefs about aging and memory. Earlier experiments (e.g., Ryan, 1992) had demonstrated that more frequent everyday memory problems are expected for typical older adults than for typical young adults. We used three self-efficacy scales of the Metamemory in Adulthood instrument (Dixon {\&} Hultsch, 1983) to examine whether age changes are anticipated for oneself as well as for typical adults. Volunteers (N = 224; mean age = 35 years) completed the questionnaire about the memory of either typical adults (aged 25, 45, 65, or 85 years) or themselves at one of these ages. The anticipation of decline was obtained on two of the three self-efficacy scales (i.e., capacity and change) for both typical adults and for oneself. In contrast to Ryan's 1992 study, significant differentiation between target ages of 45 and 65 was observed on these more age-sensitive measures. Beliefs about memory change across adulthood were no weaker for the self than for typical others. Hence, this study supports the potential influence of general age-based beliefs upon individual self-efficacy beliefs and memory performance.},

@article{Dehejia1999,
abstract = {This article uses propensity score methods to estimate the treatment impact of the National Supported Work (NSW) Demonstration, a labor training program, on postintervention earnings. We use data from Lalonde's evaluation of nonexperimental methods that combine the treated units from a randomized evaluation of the NSW with nonexperimental comparison units drawn from survey datasets. We apply propensity score methods to this composite dataset and demonstrate that, relative to the estimators that Lalonde evaluates, propensity score estimates of the treatment impact are much closer to the experimental benchmark estimate. Propensity score methods assume that the variables associated with assignment to treatment are observed (referred to as ignorable treatment assignment, or selection on observables). Even under this assumption, it is difficult to control for differences between the treatment and comparison groups when they are dissimilar and when there are many preintervention variables. The estimated propensity score (the probability of assignment to treatment, conditional on preintervention variables) summarizes the preintervention variables. This offers a diagnostic on the comparability of the treatment and comparison groups, because one has only to compare the estimated propensity score across the two groups. We discuss several methods (such as stratification and matching) that use the propensity score to estimate the treatment impact. When the range of estimated propensity scores of the treatment and comparison groups overlap, these methods can estimate the treatment impact for the treatment group. A sensitivity analysis shows that our estimates are not sensitive to the specification of the estimated propensity score, but are sensitive to the assumption of selection on observables. We conclude that when the treatment and comparison groups overlap, and when the variables determining assignment to treatment are observed, these methods provide a means to estimate the treatment impact. Even though propensity score methods are not always applicable, they offer a diagnostic on the quality of nonexperimental comparison groups in terms of observable preintervention variables},

abstract = {As descendants of the indigenous peoples of the United States, American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) have experienced a resurgence in population and prospects since the beginning of the twentieth century. Today, tribally affiliated individuals number over two million, distributed across 565 federally recognized tribal communities and countless metropolitan and nonreservation rural areas. Although relatively little evidence is available, the existing data suggest that AI/AN adults and youth suffer a disproportionate burden of mental health problems compared with other Americans. Specifically, clear disparities have emerged for AI/AN substance abuse, posttraumatic stress, violence, and suicide. The rapid expansion of mental health services to AI/AN communities has, however, frequently preceded careful consideration of a variety of questions about critical components of such care, such as the service delivery structure itself, clinical treatment processes, and preventive and rehabilitative program evaluation. As a consequence, the mental health needs of these communities have easily outpaced and overwhelmed the federally funded agency designed to serve these populations, with the Indian Health Service remaining chronically understaffed and underfunded such that elimination of AI/AN mental health disparities is only a distant dream. Although research published during the past decade has substantially improved knowledge about AI/AN mental health problems, far fewer investigations have explored treatment efficacy and outcomes among these culturally diverse peoples. In addition to routine calls for greater clinical and research resources, however, AI/AN community members themselves are increasingly advocating for culturally alternative approaches and opportunities to address their mental health needs on their own terms.},

abstract = {The eukaryotic RNA exosome is an essential, multi-subunit complex that catalyzes RNA turnover, maturation, and quality control processes. Its non-catalytic donut-shaped core includes 9 subunits that associate with the 3' to 5' exoribonucleases Rrp6, and Rrp44/Dis3, a subunit that also catalyzes endoribonuclease activity. Although recent structures and biochemical studies of RNA bound exosomes from S. cerevisiae revealed that the Exo9 central channel guides RNA to either Rrp6 or Rrp44 using partially overlapping and mutually exclusive paths, several issues related to RNA recruitment remain. Here, we identify activities for the highly basic Rrp6 C-terminal tail that we term the 'lasso' because it binds RNA and stimulates ribonuclease activities associated with Rrp44 and Rrp6 within the 11-subunit nuclear exosome. Stimulation is dependent on the Exo9 central channel, and the lasso contributes to degradation and processing activities of exosome substrates in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we present evidence that the Rrp6 lasso may be a conserved feature of the eukaryotic RNA exosome.},

There is a dearth of long term, follow-up studies after sex reassignment. Objective: To estimate mortality, morbidity, and criminal rate after surgical sex reassignment of transsexual persons. Design: A population-based matched cohort study. Setting: Sweden, 1973-2003. Participants: All 324 sex-reassigned persons (191 male-to-females, 133 female-to-males) in Sweden, 1973-2003. Random population controls (10:1) were matched by birth year and birth sex or reassigned (final) sex, respectively. Main Outcome Measures: Hazard ratios (HR) with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) for mortality and psychiatric morbidity were obtained with Cox regression models, which were adjusted for immigrant status and psychiatric morbidity prior to sex reassignment (adjusted HR [aHR]). Results: The overall mortality for sex-reassigned persons was higher during follow-up (aHR 2.8; 95{\%} CI 1.8-4.3) than for controls of the same birth sex, particularly death from suicide (aHR 19.1; 95{\%} CI 5.8-62.9). Sex-reassigned persons also had an increased risk for suicide attempts (aHR 4.9; 95{\%} CI 2.9-8.5) and psychiatric inpatient care (aHR 2.8; 95{\%} CI 2.0-3.9). Comparisons with controls matched on reassigned sex yielded similar results. Female-to-males, but not male-to-females, had a higher risk for criminal convictions than their respective birth sex controls. Conclusions: Persons with transsexualism, after sex reassignment, have considerably higher risks for mortality, suicidal behaviour, and psychiatric morbidity than the general population. Our findings suggest that sex reassignment, although alleviating gender dysphoria, may not suffice as treatment for transsexualism, and should inspire improved psychiatric and somatic care after sex reassignment for this patient group. {\textcopyright} 2011 Dhejne et al.},

abstract = {Despite women's increased labor force attachment over the lifecycle, household surveys such as the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC) do not show increases in retirement income (pensions, 401(k)s, IRAs) for women at older ages. We use linked survey-administrative data to demonstrate that retirement incomes are considerably underreported in the CPS ASEC and that women's economic progress at older ages has been substantially understated over the last quarter century. Specifically, the CPS ASEC shows median household income for women age 65-69 rose 21 percent since the late 1980s, while the administrative records show an increase of 58 percent. Survey biases in women's own incomes appear largest for women with the longest work histories. We also exploit the panel dimension of our data to follow a cohort of women and their spouses (if present) as they transition into retirement in recent years. In contrast to previous work, we find that most women do not experience noticeable drops in income up to five years after claiming social security, with retirement income playing an important role in maintaining their overall standard of living. Our results pose a challenge to the literature on the “retirement consumption puzzle” and suggest total income.},

It is widely recognized that changes in technology and competition have diminished many of the traditional roles of location. Yet clusters, or geographic concentrations of interconnected companies, are a striking feature of virtually every national, regional, state, and even metropolitan economy, especially in more advanced nations. The prevalence of clusters reveals important insights about the microeconomics of competition and the role of location in competitive advantage. Even as old reasons for clustering have diminished in importance with globalization, new influences of clusters on competition have taken on growing importance in an increasingly complex, knowledge-based, and dynamic economy. Clusters represent a new way of thinking about national, state, and local economies, and they necessitate new roles for companies, government, and other institutions in enhancing competitiveness.},

In this article, I conduct the first meta-analysis of all experiments that examine elite responsiveness to constituent communication. I find that racial/ethnic minorities and messages sent to elected officials (as opposed to non-elected) are significantly less likely to receive a response. A qualitative review of the literature further suggests that some of these inequalities in responsiveness are driven by personal biases of public officials, rather than strategic, electoral considerations. The findings of this study provide important qualifications and context to prominent individual studies in the field.},

Data for 2007–8 support previous findings (in Canada and Austria) indicating that lesbians face hiring discrimination. The study finds that the estimated probability of lesbian applicants receiving an invitation for an interview is 27.7 percent lower than that for heterosexual women applicants. More importantly, the study shows that entry wage differentials assigned are inconsistent with the ascendant empirical claims (from the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom) that lesbians have higher market earnings. The study concludes that the negative effect of lesbian sexual orientation on wage outcomes in Greece is 6.1 percent. Given that legal actions in Greece have the potential to affect sexual-orientation minorities, it is important to understand the relationships between sexual orientation and the labor market.},

Moreover, disability discrimination laws can affect nondisabled older workers because they are fairly likely to develop work-related disabilities, but are generally not protected by these laws. Using state variation in disability discrimination protections, we find little or no evidence that stronger disability discrimination laws lower the hiring of nondisabled older workers.

abstract = {A key policy question is whether the benefits of additional medical expenditures exceed their costs. We propose a new approach for estimating marginal returns to medical spending based on variation in medical inputs generated by diagnostic thresholds. Specifically, we combine regression discontinuity estimates that compare health outcomes and medical treatment provision for newborns on either side of the very low birth weight threshold at 1,500 grams. First, using data on the census of U.S. births in available years from 1983 to 2002, we find that newborns with birth weights just below 1,500 grams have lower one-year mortality rates than do newborns with birth weights just above this cutoff, even though mortality risk tends to decrease with birth weight. One-year mortality falls by approximately one percentage point as birth weight crosses 1,500 grams from above, which is large relative to mean infant mortality of 5.5{\%} just above 1,500 grams. Second, using hospital discharge records for births in five states in available years from 1991 to 2006, we find that newborns with birth weights just below 1,500 grams have discontinuously higher charges and frequencies of specific medical inputs. Hospital costs increase by approximately {\$}4,000 as birth weight crosses 1,500 grams from above, relative to mean hospital costs of {\$}40,000 just above 1,500 grams. Under an assumption that observed medical spending fully captures the impact of the “very low birth weight” designation on mortality, our estimates suggest that the cost of saving a statistical life of a newborn with birth weight near 1,500 grams is on the order of {\$}550,000 in 2006 dollars.},

Instead, the authors show that this approach helps students recognize that they and many other people may hold implicit biases that can affect perceptions and actions and realize that prejudice is not reducible to overt bigotry. The authors also show that the exercise helped some students recognize that talking about race and challenging unconscious associations are better methods of combating prejudice than simply pretending not to notice race. Qualitative and quantitative data reveal that the approach described here was effective in building students' understanding of unconscious prejudice. Keywords},

Only a few studies have looked at how manufacturing firms locate their production facilities geographically; they have used either small manufacturing samples or small geographic regions. This paper provides broader evidence of the impact of plant relocations using confidential establishment level data from the US Census Longitudinal Research Database (LRD), covering the full population of manufacturing establishments in the United States over the period from 1972 to 1992. This paper finds a relatively small role for relocation in explaining the disparity of manufacturing employment growth rates across states. Moreover, it finds evidence of very weak effects of incentive programs on plant relocations. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

It was considered that specific aspects of ethnic identity (in-group affect, centrality, in-group ties) could serve as resilience and/or vulnerability factors. Whereas in-group affect (positive feelings regarding one's group) was directly associated with decreased depressive symptoms and buffered against perceived discrimination, high levels of centrality (salience of group membership) was associated with increased symptomatology and intensified the relation between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms. In-group ties (connection to other group members) buffered against perceived discrimination, although this protective effect only applied for males. The data underscore the importance of examining different aspects of identity and gender differences in determining the role of ethnic identity in the well-being of minority populations.},

Assessing their health status and health needs is key to inform health policy formulation and program implementation. To this end, we conducted a scoping review of the literature and national statistics on Hispanic health in the USA using a modified social-ecological framework that includes social determinants of health, health disparities, risk factors, and health services, as they shape the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. These social, environmental, and biological forces have modified the epidemiologic profile of Hispanics in the USA, with cancer being the leading cause of mortality, followed by cardiovascular diseases and unintentional injuries. Implementation of the Affordable Care Act has resulted in improved access to health services for Hispanics, but challenges remain due to limited cultural sensitivity, health literacy, and a shortage of Hispanic health care providers. Acculturation barriers and underinsured or uninsured status remain as major obstacles to health care access. Advantageous health outcomes from the “Hispanic Mortality Paradox” and the “Latina Birth Outcomes Paradox” persist, but health gains may be offset in the future by increasing rates of obesity and diabetes. Recommendations focus on the adoption of the Health in All Policies framework, expanding access to health care, developing cultural sensitivity in the health care workforce, and generating and disseminating research findings on Hispanic health.},

We first provide new descriptive evidence showing that there is significant distress and an increase in demand for high interest loans in the run-up to eviction court for both evicted and non-evicted tenants. We then estimate the causal effect of an eviction order on financial strain, household moves, and neighborhood quality, leveraging the random assignment of cases to judges in eviction court for identification. The effects are small relative to the financial strain experienced by tenants in the run-up to eviction cour},

An alternative view proposes that aging corresponds with stronger prejudice among older adults because they have reduced capacity to inhibit biased associations that come to mind automatically. To independently assess these possibilities, we modeled the processes underlying implicit racial attitudes in samples of teenagers through people in their nineties. Results indicated that older adults showed greater implicit bias because they were less able to regulate the automatic associations they possessed, not because of holding stronger associations in the first place. These findings suggest that age-related increases in racial biases, even those that are implicit, may be due to self-regulatory failure of older adults, rather than to cohort effects. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

It explains howposterior distributions are the basis for inference and explores their basic properties. TheBernoulli distribution is used as a simple example. Various methods of specifying prior distributions are considered, with special emphasis on subject-matter considerations and exchange ability. The regression model is examined to showhowanalytical methods may fail in the derivation of marginal posterior distributions, which leads to an explanation of classical andMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods of simulation. The latter is proceeded by a brief introduction toMarkov chains. The remainder of the book is concernedwith applications of the theory to important models that are used in economics, political science, biostatistics, and other applied fields.These include the linear regression model and extensions to Tobit, probit, and logit models; time series models; and models involving endogenous variables.},

The purpose of this paper is to resolve this paradox by explaining why and how geography matters for innovative activity and ultimately for the interna- tional comparative advantage. Globalization and the telecommunications revolution have triggered a shift in the comparative advantage of the leading developed countries towards an increased importance of innovative activity. This shift in comparative advantage has increased the value of knowledge-based economic activity. Since knowledge is generated and transmitted more efficiently via local proximity, economic activity based on new knowledge has a high propensity to cluster within a geographic region. This has triggered a fundamental shift in public policy towards business, away from policies constraining the freedom of firms to contract and towards a new set of enabling policies, implemented at the regional and local levels.

The mechanisms through which social determinants, including racism, exert their deleterious effects on black health are discussed at the macro and individual levels. Incarceration and mental health care issues are highlighted as priorities to be addressed. African Americans remain the least healthy ethnic group in the USA, a somber legacy of years of racial and social injustice and a formidable challenge to equitable health care for all. Systemic causes of suboptimal black health require equally systemic solutions; positive trends in black health indicators seem to be driven by social development programs, economic investment in education, participation of African Americans in policy, and decision-making and expansion of access to health care.},

abstract = {This paper provides evidence that a person's gender influences the way others in-terpret information about his or her ability and documents the implications for gender inequality in labor markets. Using data on primary care physicians' (PCPs) referrals to surgeons, I find that PCPs view patient outcomes differently depending on the per-forming surgeon's gender. PCPs become more pessimistic about a female surgeon's ability than a male's after a patient death, indicated by a sharper drop in referrals to the female surgeon. However, PCPs become more optimistic about a male surgeon's ability after a good patient outcome, indicated by a larger increase in the number of referrals the male surgeon receives. PCPs also change their behavior toward other fe-male surgeons after a bad experience with one female surgeon, becoming less likely to refer to new women in the same specialty. There are no such spillovers to other men after a bad experience with one male surgeon.

abstract = {An econometric model for total employment growth and for employment growth in 6 separate industries in states during the period 1973-1980 is specified and estimated. The data consist of employment trends as reported in County Business Patterns for the week of March 12 in each year. Results show that higher wages, utility prices, personal income tax rates, and a rise in the overall level of taxation discourage employment growth in several industries. However, factors such as higher state and local spending on education and per capita income are found to favorably affect job growth. In examining the implications of these findings for employment growth rates in several states, it is found that slow growth in some states, such as Pennsylvania, cannot be attributed to taxes, while part of New York's slow growth results from high taxes. On the other hand, rapid growth states, such as Florida and Texas, have positive growth conditions for nearly all of the independent variables used to explain growth.},

First, emails sent by female students were more likely to receive a response than those sent by male students, especially when the official was male. Second, the responses that women received were as likely to be long, thoughtful, and contain an offer of help as those to men. Third, there were no partisan differences in responsiveness to male or female senders. Examining senders with Hispanic last names bolsters the results: Hispanic senders, especially men, were less likely to receive a quality response than non-Hispanic senders. Thus, politicians may condition responsiveness and helpfulness on the ethnicity of constituents, but women who are self-starters in search of advice receive equal treatment.},

Because empathy plays a key functional role in social behavior, brain imaging researchers have extensively investigated the neurocognitive underpinnings of racial ingroup bias in empathy. This research has revealed consistent evidence for increased neural responses to the perceived pain of same-race compared with other-race individuals in multiple brain regions and across multiple time-windows. Researchers have also examined neurocognitive, sociocultural, and environmental influences on racial ingroup bias in empathic neural responses, as well as explored possible interventions to reduce racial ingroup bias in empathic brain activity. These findings have important implications for understanding racial ingroup favoritism in social behavior and for improving interracial communication.},

Findings from the Web-based Internet survey revealed that many gay and bisexual men experienced heterosexist harassment, rejection, and discrimination at least once in a while during the past year and that these experiences were positively related to psychological distress. Results also indicated that self-esteem moderated the relationship between heterosexist events and psychological distress, with significant risk being associated with low self-esteem. No support was found for the moderating roles of social support and avoidant coping in the link between heterosexist events and psychological distress. (Contains 1 figure and 3 tables.)},

Returns to women are somewhat smaller than those to men. The highest returns are observed for the younger cohort of men which may be an indication of recent higher demand for educated personnel. Vocational and technical high school graduate men have not only a higher probability of working as wage earners but also significantly higher returns than general high school graduates.

Beginning in July 1992, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 requires employers to provide reasonable accommodation to workers with disabilities. Here we use a continuous time hazard model on retrospective data from the 1978 Social Security Survey of Disability and Work to estimate the effect of employer accommodation on the subsequent job tenure of workers who suffer a work limiting health impairment. We show that the risk of leaving one's employer is significantly influenced both by accommodation and by the Social Security Disability Insurance replacement rate. Accommodation appears to be as important as a worker's expected replacement rate in influencing his risk of job exit.},

@misc{Practices2006,
abstract = {This summary was written and compiled by Karin Kirk, SERC, and contains an overview of motivation research and pertinent references.Self efficacy is commonly defined as the belief in one's capabilities to achieve a goal or an outcome. Students with a strong sense of efficacy are more likely to challenge themselves with difficult tasks and be intrinsically motivated. These students will put forth a high degree of effort in order to meet their commitments, and attribute failure to things which are in their control, rather than blaming external factors. Self-efficacious students also recover quickly from setbacks, and ultimately are likely to achieve their personal goals. Students with low self-efficacy, on the other hand, believe they cannot be successful and thus are less likely to make a concerted, extended effort and may consider challenging tasks as threats that are to be avoided. Thus, students with poor self-efficacy have low aspirations which may result in disappointing academic performances becoming part of a self-fulfilling feedback cycle. (Bandura (more info)) [Margolis and McCabe, 2006] How can students gain self-efficacy? There are four sources of self-efficacy. Teachers can use strategies to build self-efficacy in various ways. Mastery experiences-Students' successful experiences boost self-efficacy, while failures erode it. This is the most robust source of self-efficacy. Vicarious experience-Observing a peer succeed at a task can strengthen beliefs in one's own abilities. Verbal persuasion-Teachers can boost self-efficacy with credible communication and feedback to guide the student through the task or motivate them to make their best effort. Emotional state-A positive mood can boost one's beliefs in self-efficacy, while anxiety can undermine it. A certain level of emotional stimulation can create an energizing feeling that can contribute to strong performances. Teachers can help by reducing stressful situations and lowering anxiety surrounding events like exams or presentations. [Margolis and McCabe, 2006] and (Bandura (more info)) Pedagogic strategies that foster self-efficacy It is particularly exciting to note that teaching strategies used in the classroom can and do make a difference to students' self-efficacy. (Fencl and Scheel, 2005) Research shows that the type of learning environment and teaching method can improve self efficacy in the classroom (Bandura (more info)). A similar result was reported by Fencl and Scheel. They describe a required, nonmajors' physics course where the effects of different teaching methods on the classroom climate and self-efficacy were measured. The students' response indicated that a question and answer format, inquiry-based lab activities and conceptual (rather than quantitative) problems had a significant effect on creating a positive climate in the classroom. In addition to those pedagogies, collaborative learning and the use of electronic applications showed a positive correlation with increased self-efficacy in their student sample. Fencl and Scheel point out that the teaching methods that showed a measurable positive effect share the common feature of engaging students in a comfortable or creative manner. Moreover, pedagogies such as collaborative learning and inquiry-based activities have also been shown to have a strong correlation with how well students learn physics [Fencl and Scheel, 2005]. Bandura also concludes that cooperative learning strategies have the dual outcome of improving both self-efficacy and academic achievement. "Cooperative learning structures, in which students work together and help one another also tend to promote more positive self-evaluations of capability and higher academic attainments than do individualistic or competitive ones." (Bandura (more info)) Other pedagogies for improving self-efficacy include: Establish specific, short-term goals that will challenge the students, yet are still viewed as attainable. [Schunk and Pajares, 2002] Help students lay out a specific learning strategy and have them verbalize their plan. As students proceed through the task, ask students to note their progress and verbalize the next steps. [Schunk and Pajares, 2002] Compare student performance to the goals set for that student, rather than comparing one student against another or comparing one student to the rest of the class(Bandura (more info))..

abstract = {Focuses on 2 questions: Why do people from 1 social group oppress and discriminate against people from other groups? Why is this oppression so difficult to eliminate? The authors approach these questions using the conceptual framework of social dominance theory. This theory argues that the major forms of intergroup conflict, such as racism, classism, and patriarchy, all derive from the basic human predisposition to form, and that, beneath major and sometimes profound differences between different human societies, there is also a grammar of social power shared by all societies. The authors use social dominance theory in an attempt to identify the elements of this grammar and to understand how these elements interact and reinforce each other to produce and maintain group-based social hierarchy.},

Predictor variables (high school grade-point average, academic self-efficacy, and optimism) and moderator variables (academic expectations and self-perceived coping ability) were measured at the end of the first academic quarter and were related to classroom performance, personal adjustment, stress, and health, measured at the end of the school year. Academic self-efficacy and optimism were strongly related to performance and adjustment, both directly on academic performance and indirectly through expectations and coping perceptions (challenge-threat evaluations) on classroom performance, stress, health, and overall satisfaction and commitment to remain in school. Observed relationships corresponded closely to the hypothesized model.},

abstract = {This book explores emerging research and pedagogy in analytics and data science that have become core to many businesses as they work to derive value from data. The chapters examine the role of analytics and data science to create, spread, develop and utilize analytics applications for practice. Selected chapters provide a good balance between discussing research advances and pedagogical tools in key topic areas in analytics and data science in a systematic manner. This book also focuses on several business applications of these emerging technologies in decision making, i.e., business analytics. The chapters in Analytics and Data Science: Advances in Research and Pedagogy are written by leading academics and practitioners that participated at the Business Analytics Congress 2015. Applications of analytics and data science technologies in various domains are still evolving. For instance, the explosive growth in big data and social media analytics requires examination of the impact of these technologies and applications on business and society. As organizations in various sectors formulate their IT strategies and investments, it is imperative to understand how various analytics and data science approaches contribute to the improvements in organizational information processing and decision making. Recent advances in computational capacities coupled by improvements in areas such as data warehousing, big data, analytics, semantics, predictive and descriptive analytics, visualization, and real-time analytics have particularly strong implications on the growth of analytics and data science.},

A brief theoretical analysis of this issue is provided, emphasizing the role of scale effects and transactions costs. The empirical record of the decentralization of film-shooting activities from Hollywood over the period from the early 1980s to the early 2000s is reviewed. We describe the effects of these activities on the rise and consolidation of the Vancouver film-production complex, and we engage in a broad discussion of the spatial and economic structure of the complex. We subsequently show that many places in other countries (for example, Australia, New Zealand, Romania, the Czech Republic, Mexico, South Africa, and elsewhere) are now competing strongly with Vancouver for film-shooting activities from Hollywood. We predict that this competition is likely to intensify greatly over the next decade or so, and that the global geography of film-shooting activities will almost certainly become increasingly more variegated as new studio complexes open up around the world.},

Separate and unequal systems of health care between states, between health care systems, and between clinicians constrain the resources that are available to meet the needs of disadvantaged groups, contribute to unequal outcomes, and reinforce implicit bias. Recent data suggest slow progress in many areas but have documented a few notable successes in eliminating these disparities. To eliminate these disparities, continued progress will require a collective national will to ensure health care equity through expanded health insurance coverage, support for primary care, and public accountability based on progress toward defined, time-limited objectives using evidence-based, sufficiently resourced, multilevel quality improvement strategies that engage patients, clinicians, health care organizations, and communities.},

As such, they exist to eliminate transportation costs for goods, people and ideas and transportation technologies dictate urban form. In the 21st century, the dominant form of city living is based on the automobile and this form is sometimes called sprawl. In this essay, we document that sprawl is ubiquitous and that it is continuing to expand. Using a variety of evidence, we argue that sprawl is not the result of explicit government policies or bad urban planning, but rather the inexorable product of car-based living. Sprawl has been associated with significant improvements in quality of living, and the environmental impacts of sprawl have been offset by technological change. Finally, we suggest that the primary social problem associated with sprawl is the fact that some people are left behind because they do not earn enough to afford the cars that this form of living requires.},

@article{Ashenfelter1978,
abstract = {GOVERNMENTAL post-schooling train- ing programs have become a permanent fixture of the U.S. economy in the last decade. These programs are typically advocated for diverse reasons: (1) to reduce inflation by the provision of more skilled workers to alleviate shortages, (2) to reduce unemployment of certain groups, and (3) to reduce poverty by increasing the skills of certain groups. All of these objectives require that training programs increase the earnings of trainees above what they otherwise would be. For example, alleviat- ing shortages by training more highly skilled workers should increase the earnings of these workers. Likewise, the concern for unemployed workers is derived from a concern for the decreased earnings of these workers; and if trainees subsequently suffer less unemploy- ment, their earnings should be higher. Finally, training programs are intended to reduce poverty by increasing the earnings of low income workers. Evaluating the success of training programs is thus inherently a quantitative assessment of the effect of training on trainee earnings.' It is an important process both because it helps to inform discussions of public policy by shedding light on the past value of these programs as investments and because it can provide a means of testing our ability to augment the human capital of certain workers. Although there have been many studies of the effect of post-school classroom training on earnings it is by now rather widely agreed that very little is reliably known about the actual effects of these programs.2 Three main problems account for this state of affairs: (1) the large sample sizes required to detect relatively small anticipated program effects in a variable with such high variance as earnings, (2) the considerable expense required to keep track of trainees over a long enough period of time to measure the full inter-temporal impact of training, and (3) the extreme difficulty of implementing an adequate experimental design so as to obtain a group against which to reliably compare trainees.3 The purpose of this paper is to report on efforts to cope with this third problem using a data collection system that comes some way towards resolving the first two. The basic idea of this data system is to match the program record on each trainee with the trainee's Social Security earnings history. The Social Security Administration maintains a summary year-by-year earnings history for each Social Security account over the period since 1950 that may be used, under the appropriate confidentiality restrictions, for this purpose.4 In this paper I have concentrated on an analysis of all classroom trainees who started training under the Manpower De- velopment and Training Act (MDTA) in the first 3 months of 1964 so as to ensure their having completed training in that year. In choosing to analyze trainees from so early a cohort something is clearly lost. On the one hand, the nature of the participants in these early years was considerably different than in the later years. In particular, programs geared to the most easily trained during the high unemployment years of the early 1960s gave way to programs geared to the so-called disadvantaged worker in the late 1960s. This change shows up in program administrative statistics as sharp increases in early termina- tions (dropouts) from the training programs and a decline in the average age and education level of trainees. In more recent years the MDTA has given way to the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act and a consider- able decentralization of administrative control to state and local governments. For both of these reasons it is unclear how relevant any results for this early cohort of trainees are for current discussions of public policy. At the same time, the study of this 1964 cohort offers several advantages. First, it is technically feasible to follow this cohort's progress in the labor market for many years after training, something which cannot be done with recent cohorts. Second, if convincing estimates of trainee effects can be generated for the early years of the program these may serve as benchmarks against which to assess the desirability of the subsequent changes in the focus of government efforts in this area.},

The findings indicate that sales tax increases, relative to cross-border neighbors, lead to losses of employment, as well as payroll and hiring, but these effects are only found in counties with large shares of residents working in another state. The employment effects are also likely to be relatively short-lived, as they occur in the period before tax competition occurs and competitive jurisdictions are able to strategically respond and minimize cross-border tax differentials. Comparing estimates of sales tax effects with and without local county sales taxes show that omitting county taxes does not lead to meaningfully different estimates.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes what is known about the labor supply of older men, defined as those 55 and over. The topic is of great interest because older individuals will comprise a much greater portion of the population, so their labor supply will have a significant impact on national output, tax revenues, and the cost of means-tested programs. Most importantly, a greater proportion of older individuals will need to work than do at present, because retirement income systems are contracting and working longer is the only way for most to ensure financial security in their old age. The focus is on men, because women's work patterns reflect the increasing participation of cohorts over time as well as the factors that affect retirement behavior.},

abstract = {As a response to the greater visibility of alternative relationship and family forms, polyamory (i.e. the practice of consensual multipartner relationships) has recently moved to the centre of public media attention. Questions of polyamory have emerged as a major concern within law, social policy, family sociology, and gender and sexuality studies. Yet certain core issues have remained underexplored. This includes the distinctive nature of polyamorous intimacy, the structure of polyamorous household formations, and the dynamics of care work within poly families. In particular, poly parenting has been subject to tabooisation and scandalisation. Governing bodies, the judiciary, and educational institutions have remained largely ignorant of polyamorous relationships. Research documents the exclusions of poly families (and individuals) from access to legal provisions and protections and their common discrimination in the courts, namely, in custody cases. It further highlights the discrimination of poly-identified adolescents in school and college settings and the predicament that poly families face when interacting with public institutions (including schools and kindergartens). Insights into parenting practices and the organisation of childcare are vital for understanding the transformative potential of polyamorous ways of relating. It is also important for challenging the common demonisation and stigmatisation of polyamory within conservative family politics that perceives polyamory exclusively from a harm perspective. This article will review and critically analyse existing research on poly parenting focussing on three dimensions: (a) parenting practices, (b) social and legal discrimination, and (c) parental response to stigmatisation. The article argues for a stronger incorporation of queer perspectives within the guiding frameworks of research into parenting in consensually non-monogamous and polyamorous relationships to highlight the transformative potential of the ‘queer bonds' that sustain many of these practices.},

abstract = {Carbon sequestration — the process of moderating global climate change by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in long-term mineral, organic, and oceanic reservoirs — is an important ecosystem service provided by protected natural areas. One type of carbon sequestration that has received attention in recent years is vegetative carbon sequestration, which is the sequestration provided through plant growth. While a number of countries have developed estimates of their national vegetative carbon sequestration capacity, no estimate exists for the National Park Service (NPS) administered areas, 85{\%} of which are vegetated. This paper addresses that knowledge gap. Using federally created, peer-reviewed work on carbon sequestration rates based on a 5-year baseline period (2001-2005) of observed data, NPS boundary data, and landcover types, the study calculates the current tonnage and economic value of vegetative carbon sequestration services on all NPS units located in the continental U.S. Average projected sequestration amounts for the period 2006-2050 are also provided based on modeled data. Using conservative assumptions, we find that at present average annual carbon sequestration on NPS lands amounts to 17.5 million metric tons of CO2, valued at {\$}707 million dollars using the current federal interagency working group social cost of carbon damage price of {\$}40.45/metric ton. In the future years through 2050, absent any changes in land management (such as invasive species removal or fire management) carbon sequestration is predicted to fall by 31{\%} to an average of 12.0 million metric tons of CO2 sequestered annually, due to factors such as a warming climate, invasive species, and increased fire hazards. Given the benefits to society of avoiding this future loss in carbon sequestration, funding for management actions for the National Park Service may be economically justifiable in order to mitigate this decline, although further research is needed to better understand how specific NPS practices can maintain current carbon sequestration levels.},

abstract = {In the absence of a randomized control trial, regression discontinuity (RD) designs can produce plausible estimates of the treatment effect on an outcome for individuals near a cutoff score. In the standard RD design, individuals with rating scores higher than some exogenously determined cutoff score are assigned to one treatment condition; those with rating scores below the cutoff score are assigned to an alternate treatment condition. Many education policies, however, assign treatment status on the basis of more than one rating-score dimension. We refer to this class of RD designs as "multiple rating score regression discontinuity" (MRSRD) designs. In this paper, we discuss five different approaches to estimating treatment effects using MRSRD designs (response surface RD; frontier RD; fuzzy frontier RD; distance-based RD; and binding-score RD). We discuss differences among them in terms of their estimands, applications, statistical power, and potential extensions for studying heterogeneity of treatment effects. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Second, our findings imply that the proper use of monitoring and incentive strategies has the potential to further improve police services. Exploiting the program's change in management, we find that providing officers with more monitoring and performance incentives led the FQTF to reduce robberies by 22.12 and aggravated assaults by 5.56 each quarter.},

abstract = {Background: Previous studies examining sex-based disparities in emergency department (ED) pain care have been limited to a single pain condition, a single study site, and lack rigorous control for confounders. Objective: A multicenter evaluation of the effect of sex on abdominal pain (AP) and fracture pain (FP) care outcomes. Research Design: A retrospective cohort review of ED visits at 5 US hospitals in January, April, July, and October 2009. Subjects: A total of 6931 patients with a final ED diagnosis of FP (n = 1682) or AP (n = 5249) were included. Measures: The primary predictor was sex. The primary outcome was time to analgesic administration. Secondary outcomes included time to medication order, and the likelihood of receiving an analgesic and change in pain scores 360 minutes after triage: Multivariable models, clustered by study site, were conducted to adjust for race, age, comorbidities, initial pain score, ED crowding, and triage acuity. Results: On adjusted analyses, compared with men, women with AP waited longer for analgesic administration [AP women: 112 (65-187) minutes, men: 96 (52-167) minutes, P {\textless} 0.001] and ordering [women: 84 (41-160) minutes, men: 71 (32-137) minutes, P {\textless} 0.001], whereas women with FP did not (Administration: P = 0.360; Order: P = 0.133). Compared with men, women with AP were less likely to receive analgesics in the first 90 minutes (OR = 0.766; 95{\%} CI, 0.670-0.875; P {\textless} 0.001), whereas women with FP were not (P = 0.357). Discussion: In this multicenter study, we found that women experienced delays in analgesic administration for AP, but not for FP. Future research and interventions to decrease sex disparities in pain care should take type of pain into account.},

We conduct a large-scale correspondence test in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, sending out approx. 9000 job applications, varying job candidate's personal characteristics such as marital status and age of children. We find evidence that, for part-time jobs, married women with older kids, who likely finished their childbearing cycle and have more projectable childcare chores than women with very young kids, are at a significant advantage vis-{\`{a}}-vis other groups of women. At the same time, married, but childless applicants, who have a higher likelihood to become pregnant, are at a disadvantage compared to single, but childless applicants to part-time jobs. Such effects are not present for full-time jobs presumably because, by applying to these in contrast to part-time jobs, women signal that they have arranged for external childcare.},

abstract = {This article explores the position of polyamory in slippery slope arguments directed against the campaign for same-sex marriage rights in the United States. In the rhetoric of right-wing opponents granting same-sex marriage rights is seen as the first step on a long spiral downwards toward moral decay, which will successively normalize a whole range of problematic and ‘unwanted' practices. Polygamy and, in its close proximity, polyamory are usually the first items on a list that may also include adultery, adult incest, bestiality, and pedophilia. The article highlights the mobilization of racist and nationalist tropes at the heart of antipolygamy sentiments and considers the impact of this legacy for poly politics. Concentrating on the analysis of essays published by the Conservative journalist Stanley Kurtz, the article explores the connection between bisexuality and polyamory in some slippery slope arguments. slippery slope arguments have been a constant feature of the debates about same-sex marriage rights in the United States. Their relative prominence and strong hold within the public imagination have also affected the discourses deployed by poly activists, resulting in common disassociations from polygamy and an a reluctance to engage with questions regarding the legal recognition of multipartner relationships at all. Understanding the slippery slope dynamic is important for grasping the conditionality that contributes to the persisting hostilities against polyamory, polygamy, and LGBTQ intimacies and that shapes social movement politics.},
